# List of features {#doc_list_of_features}

This page aims to list **all** features currently supported by Godot.

> [!NOTE]
> This page lists features supported by the current stable version of
> Godot. Some of these features are not available in the [3.x release
> series](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.6/about/list_of_features.html).

## Platforms

::: {.seealso}
See `doc_system_requirements`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for hardware
and software version requirements.
:::

**Can run both the editor and exported projects:**

- Windows (x86 and ARM, 64-bit and 32-bit).

- macOS (x86 and ARM, 64-bit only).

- Linux (x86 and ARM, 64-bit and 32-bit).

  > - Binaries are statically linked and can run on any distribution if
  >   compiled on an old enough base distribution.
  > - Official binaries are compiled using the [Godot Engine
  >   buildroot](https://github.com/godotengine/buildroot), allowing for
  >   binaries that work across common Linux distributions.

- Android (editor support is experimental).

- `Web browsers <doc_using_the_web_editor>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}. Experimental in 4.0, using Godot 3.x is recommended
  instead when targeting HTML5.

**Runs exported projects:**

- iOS.
- `Consoles <doc_consoles>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

Godot aims to be as platform-independent as possible and can be
`ported to new platforms <doc_custom_platform_ports>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} with relative ease.

> [!NOTE]
> Projects written in C# using Godot 4 currently cannot be exported to
> the web platform. To use C# on that platform, consider Godot 3
> instead. Android and iOS platform support is available as of Godot

## Rendering

3 rendering *methods* (running over 2 rendering *drivers*) are
available:

- **Forward+**, running over Vulkan 1.0 (with optional Vulkan 1.1 and
  1.2 features). The most advanced graphics backend, suited for desktop
  platforms only. Used by default on desktop platforms.
- **Forward Mobile**, running over Vulkan 1.0 (with optional Vulkan 1.1
  and 1.2 features). Less features, but renders simple scenes faster.
  Suited for mobile and desktop platforms. Used by default on mobile
  platforms.
- **Compatibility**, running over OpenGL 3.3 / OpenGL ES 3.0 / WebGL
  2.0. The least advanced graphics backend, suited for low-end desktop
  and mobile platforms. Used by default on the web platform.

See `doc_renderers`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for a detailed
comparison of the rendering methods.

## 2D graphics {#d-graphics}

  > - Custom shaders can access a real-time
  >   `SDF (Signed Distance Field)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
  >   representation of the 2D scene based on
  >   `class_LightOccluder2D`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} nodes, which
  >   can be used for improved 2D lighting effects including 2D global
  >   illumination.

  performance in complex scenes by reducing the cost of overdraw.
- `doc_variable_rate_shading`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} on supported
  GPUs in Forward+ and Forward Mobile.

**Physically-based rendering (built-in material features):**

- Follows the Disney PBR model.
- Supports Burley, Lambert, Lambert Wrap (half-Lambert) and Toon diffuse
  shading modes.
- Supports Schlick-GGX, Toon and Disabled specular shading modes.

  through the transparent pipeline.
- Dithering can be determined on a per-pixel or per-object basis.

**Real-time lighting:**

- Directional lights (sun/moon). Up to 4 per scene.
- Omnidirectional lights.
- Spot lights with adjustable cone angle and attenuation.
- Specular, indirect light, and volumetric fog energy can be adjusted on
  a per-light basis.
- Adjustable light \"size\" for fake area lights (will also make shadows
  blurrier).
- Optional distance fade system to fade distant lights and their
  shadows, improving performance.
- When using the Forward+ backend (default on desktop), lights are
  rendered with clustered forward optimizations to decrease their
  individual cost. Clustered rendering also lifts any limits on the
  number of lights that can be used on a mesh.
- When using the Forward Mobile backend, up to 8 omni lights and 8 spot
  lights can be displayed per mesh resource. Baked lighting can be used
  to overcome this limit if needed.

**Shadow mapping:**

- *DirectionalLight:* Orthogonal (fastest), PSSM 2-split and 4-split.
  Supports blending between splits.

  accurate). Supports colored projector textures in the form of
  panoramas.
- *SpotLight:* Single texture. Supports colored projector textures.
- Shadow normal offset bias and shadow pancaking to decrease the amount
  of visible shadow acne and peter-panning.

  >   indirect lighting. The bake mode can be adjusted on a per-light
  >   basis to allow for hybrid light baking setups.
  > - Supports lighting dynamic objects using automatic and manually
  >   placed probes.
  > - Optionally supports directional lighting and rough reflections
  >   based on spherical harmonics.
  > - Lightmaps are baked on the GPU using compute shaders (much faster
  >   compared to CPU lightmapping). Baking can only be performed from
  >   the editor, not in exported projects.
  > - Supports GPU-based
  >   `denoising <doc_using_lightmap_gi_denoising>`{.interpreted-text
  >   role="ref"} with JNLM, or CPU/GPU-based denoising with OIDN.

- `Voxel-based GI probes <doc_using_voxel_gi>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}. Supports dynamic lights *and* dynamic occluders, while
  also supporting reflections. Requires a fast baking step which can be
  performed in the editor or at run-time (including from an exported
  project).

- VoxelGI and SDFGI use a deferred pass to allow for rendering GI at
  half resolution to improve performance (while still having functional
  MSAA support).

  reflections (when using signed distance field GI). Voxel-based
  reflections are visible on transparent surfaces, while rough SDF-based
  reflections are visible on transparent surfaces.

  ReflectionProbe. Parallax box correction can optionally be enabled.
- Screen-space reflections with support for material roughness.
- Reflection techniques can be mixed together for greater accuracy or
  scalability.
- When using the Forward+ backend (default on desktop), reflection
  probes are rendered with clustered forward optimizations to decrease
  their individual cost. Clustered rendering also lifts any limits on
  the number of reflection probes that can be used on a mesh.
- When using the Forward Mobile backend, up to 8 reflection probes can
  be displayed per mesh resource. When using the Compatibility renderer,
  up to 2 reflection probes can be displayed per mesh resource.

**Decals:**

- `Supports albedo <doc_using_decals>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},

  filtering (configured globally).
- Optional distance fade system to fade distant decals, improving
  performance.
- When using the Forward+ backend (default on desktop), decals are
  rendered with clustered forward optimizations to decrease their
  individual cost. Clustered rendering also lifts any limits on the
  number of decals that can be used on a mesh.
- When using the Forward Mobile backend, up to 8 decals can be displayed
  per mesh resource.

**Sky:**

- Panorama sky (using an HDRI).
- Procedural sky and Physically-based sky that respond to the
  DirectionalLights in the scene.

  role="ref"} that reacts to lights and shadows.
- Volumetric fog can take indirect light into account when using VoxelGI
  or SDFGI.
- Fog volume nodes that can be placed to add fog to specific areas (or
  remove fog from specific areas). Supported shapes include box,
  ellipse, cone, cylinder, and 3D texture-based density maps.
- Each fog volume can have its own custom shader.
- Can be used together with traditional fog.

**Particles:**

- GPU-based particles with support for subemitters (2D + 3D), trails
  (2D + 3D), attractors (3D only) and collision (2D + 3D).
  - 3D particle attractor shapes supported: box, sphere and 3D vector
    fields.
  - 3D particle collision shapes supported: box, sphere, baked signed
    distance field and real-time heightmap (suited for open world
    weather effects).
  - 2D particle collision is handled using a signed distance field
    generated in real-time based on
    `class_LightOccluder2D`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} nodes in the

  `used as a screen-space blur effect <doc_environment_and_post_processing_using_glow_to_blur_the_screen>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.
- Color correction using a one-dimensional ramp or a 3D LUT texture.
- Roughness limiter to reduce the impact of specular aliasing.
- Brightness, contrast and saturation adjustments.

**Texture filtering:**

- Nearest, bilinear, trilinear or anisotropic filtering.
- Filtering options are defined on a per-use basis, not a per-texture
  basis.

**Resolution scaling:**

- Support for
  `rendering 3D at a lower resolution <doc_resolution_scaling>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} while keeping 2D rendering at the original scale. This can
  be used to improve performance on low-end systems or improve visuals
  on high-end systems.
- Resolution scaling uses bilinear filtering, AMD FidelityFX Super
  Resolution 1.0 (FSR1) or AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 2.2 (FSR2).
- Texture mipmap LOD bias is adjusted automatically to improve quality
  at lower resolution scales. It can also be modified with a manual
  offset.

Most effects listed above can be adjusted for better performance or to

  platforms).

- Fullscreen mode.

  > - Uses borderless fullscreen by default on Windows for fast
  >   alt-tabbing, but can optionally use exclusive fullscreen to reduce
  >   input lag.

- Borderless windows (fullscreen or non-fullscreen).

- Ability to keep a window always on top.

- Global menu integration on macOS.

- Execute commands in a blocking or non-blocking manner (including
  running multiple instances of the same project).

- Open file paths and URLs using default or custom protocol handlers (if
  registered on the system).

- Parse custom command line arguments.

- Any Godot binary (editor or exported project) can be
  `used as a headless server <doc_exporting_for_dedicated_servers>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} by starting it with the `--headless` command line
  argument. This allows running the engine without a GPU or display
  server.

## Mobile

- In-app purchases on
  `Android <doc_android_in_app_purchases>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
  and `iOS <doc_plugins_for_ios>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
- Support for advertisements using third-party modules.

## XR support (AR and VR)

- Out of the box
  `support for OpenXR <doc_setting_up_xr>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.

  > - Including support for popular desktop headsets like the Valve
  >   Index, WMR headsets, and Quest over Link.

- Support for
  `Android based headsets <doc_deploying_to_android>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} using OpenXR through a plugin.

  - Including support for popular stand alone headsets like the Meta
    Quest 1/2/3 and Pro, Pico 4, Magic Leap 2, and Lynx R1.

- Other devices supported through an XR plugin structure.

- Various advanced toolkits are available that implement common features
  required by XR applications.

## GUI system

Godot\'s GUI is built using the same Control nodes used to make games in
Godot. The editor UI can easily be extended in many ways using add-ons.

**Nodes:**

- Buttons.
- Checkboxes, check buttons, radio buttons.
- Text entry using `class_LineEdit`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
  (single line) and `class_TextEdit`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
  (multiple lines). TextEdit also supports code editing features such as
  displaying line numbers and syntax highlighting.
- Dropdown menus using `class_PopupMenu`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
  and `class_OptionButton`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
- Scrollbars.
- Labels.
- RichTextLabel for
  `text formatted using BBCode <doc_bbcode_in_richtextlabel>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}, with support for animated custom effects.
- Trees (can also be used to represent tables).
- Color picker with RGB and HSV modes.
- Controls can be rotated and scaled.

**Sizing:**

- Anchors to keep GUI elements in a specific corner, edge or centered.

- Containers to place GUI elements automatically following certain
  rules.

  > - `Stack <class_BoxContainer>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
  >   layouts.
  > - `Grid <class_GridContainer>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
  >   layouts.
  > - `Flow <class_FlowContainer>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} layouts
  >   (similar to autowrapping text).
  > - `Margin <class_MarginContainer>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
  >   `centered <class_CenterContainer>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
  >   and `aspect ratio <class_AspectRatioContainer>`{.interpreted-text
  >   role="ref"} layouts.
  > - `Draggable splitter <class_SplitContainer>`{.interpreted-text
  >   role="ref"} layouts.

- Scale to
  `multiple resolutions <doc_multiple_resolutions>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} using the `canvas_items` or `viewport` stretch modes.

- Support any aspect ratio using anchors and the `expand` stretch
  aspect.

**Theming:**

- Built-in theme editor.

  > - Generate a theme based on the current editor theme settings.

- Procedural vector-based theming using
  `class_StyleBoxFlat`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

  > - Supports rounded/beveled corners, drop shadows, per-border widths
  >   and antialiasing.

- Texture-based theming using `class_StyleBoxTexture`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.

Godot\'s small distribution size can make it a suitable alternative to
frameworks like Electron or Qt.

## Animation

- Direct kinematics and inverse kinematics.
- Support for animating any property with customizable interpolation.
- Support for calling methods in animation tracks.
- Support for playing sounds in animation tracks.
- Support for Bézier curves in animation.

## File formats

- Scenes and resources can be saved in
  `text-based <doc_tscn_file_format>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} or
  binary formats.

  > - Text-based formats are human-readable and more friendly to version
  >   control.
  > - Binary formats are faster to save/load for large scenes/resources.

- Read and write text or binary files using
  `class_FileAccess`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

  > - Can optionally be compressed or encrypted.

- Read and write `class_JSON`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} files.

- Read and write INI-style configuration files using
  `class_ConfigFile`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

  > - Can (de)serialize any Godot datatype, including Vector2/3, Color,
  >   \...

- Read XML files using `class_XMLParser`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

- `Load and save images, audio/video, fonts and ZIP archives <doc_runtime_loading_and_saving>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} in an exported project without having to go through
  Godot\'s import system.

- Pack game data into a PCK file (custom format optimized for fast
  seeking), into a ZIP archive, or directly into the executable for
  single-file distribution.

- `Export additional PCK files<doc_exporting_pcks>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} that can be read by the engine to support mods and DLCs.

## Miscellaneous

- `Video playback <doc_playing_videos>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
  with built-in support for Ogg Theora.

- `Movie Maker mode <doc_creating_movies>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
  to record videos from a running project with synchronized audio and
  perfect frame pacing.

- `Low-level access to servers <doc_using_servers>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} which allows bypassing the scene tree\'s overhead when
  needed.

- `Command line interface <doc_command_line_tutorial>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} for automation.

  > - Export and deploy projects using continuous integration platforms.
  > - [Shell completion
  >   scripts](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/tree/master/misc/dist/shell)
  >   are available for Bash, zsh and fish.
  > - Print colored text to standard output on all platforms using
  >   `print_rich <class_@GlobalScope_method_print_rich>`{.interpreted-text
  >   role="ref"}.

- Support for
  `C++ modules <doc_custom_modules_in_cpp>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} statically linked into the engine binary.

- Engine and editor written in C++17.

  > - Can be
  >   `compiled <doc_introduction_to_the_buildsystem>`{.interpreted-text
  >   role="ref"} using GCC, Clang and MSVC. MinGW is also supported.
  > - Friendly towards packagers. In most cases, system libraries can be
  >   used instead of the ones provided by Godot. The build system
  >   doesn\'t download anything. Builds can be fully reproducible.

- Licensed under the permissive MIT license.

  > - Open development process with
  >   `contributions welcome <doc_ways_to_contribute>`{.interpreted-text
  >   role="ref"}.
