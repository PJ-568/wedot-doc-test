# HTTPClient {#class_HTTPClient}

**Inherits:** `RefCounted<class_RefCounted>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **\<** `Object<class_Object>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

Low-level hyper-text transfer protocol client.

::: {.rst-class}
classref-introduction-group
:::

## Description

Hyper-text transfer protocol client (sometimes called \"User Agent\").
Used to make HTTP requests to download web content, upload files and
other data or to communicate with various services, among other use
cases.

See the `HTTPRequest<class_HTTPRequest>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
node for a higher-level alternative.

\*\*Note:\*\* This client only needs to connect to a host once (see
`connect_to_host<class_HTTPClient_method_connect_to_host>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}) to send multiple requests. Because of this, methods that
take URLs usually take just the part after the host instead of the full
URL, as the client is already connected to a host. See
`request<class_HTTPClient_method_request>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
for a full example and to get started.

A **HTTPClient** should be reused between multiple requests or to
connect to different hosts instead of creating one client per request.
Supports Transport Layer Security (TLS), including server certificate
verification. HTTP status codes in the 2xx range indicate success, 3xx
redirection (i.e. \"try again, but over here\"), 4xx something was wrong
with the request, and 5xx something went wrong on the server\'s side.

For more information on HTTP, see [MDN\'s documentation on
HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP) (or read [RFC
2616](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616) to get it straight from the
source).

\*\*Note:\*\* When exporting to Android, make sure to enable the
`INTERNET` permission in the Android export preset before exporting the
project or using one-click deploy. Otherwise, network communication of
any kind will be blocked by Android.

\*\*Note:\*\* It\'s recommended to use transport encryption (TLS) and to
avoid sending sensitive information (such as login credentials) in HTTP
GET URL parameters. Consider using HTTP POST requests or HTTP headers
for such information instead.

\*\*Note:\*\* When performing HTTP requests from a project exported to
Web, keep in mind the remote server may not allow requests from foreign
origins due to
[CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS). If you
host the server in question, you should modify its backend to allow
requests from foreign origins by adding the
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` HTTP header.

\*\*Note:\*\* TLS support is currently limited to TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3.
Attempting to connect to a server that only supports older (insecure)
TLS versions will return an error.

\*\*Warning:\*\* TLS certificate revocation and certificate pinning are
currently not supported. Revoked certificates are accepted as long as
they are otherwise valid. If this is a concern, you may want to use
automatically managed certificates with a short validity period.

classref-enumeration
:::
::::

enum **Method**: `🔗<enum_HTTPClient_Method>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_METHOD_GET}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`Method<enum_HTTPClient_Method>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
**METHOD_GET** = `0`

HTTP GET method. The GET method requests a representation of the
specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_METHOD_HEAD}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`Method<enum_HTTPClient_Method>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
**METHOD_HEAD** = `1`

HTTP HEAD method. The HEAD method asks for a response identical to that
of a GET request, but without the response body. This is useful to
request metadata like HTTP headers or to check if a resource exists.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_METHOD_POST}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`Method<enum_HTTPClient_Method>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
**METHOD_POST** = `2`

HTTP POST method. The POST method is used to submit an entity to the
specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on
the server. This is often used for forms and submitting data or
uploading files.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_METHOD_PUT}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`Method<enum_HTTPClient_Method>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
**METHOD_PUT** = `3`

HTTP PUT method. The PUT method asks to replace all current
representations of the target resource with the request payload. (You
can think of POST as \"create or update\" and PUT as \"update\",
although many services tend to not make a clear distinction or change
their meaning).

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_METHOD_DELETE}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`Method<enum_HTTPClient_Method>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
**METHOD_DELETE** = `4`

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_CONTINUE** = `100`

HTTP status code `100 Continue`. Interim response that indicates
everything so far is OK and that the client should continue with the
request (or ignore this status if already finished).

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_SWITCHING_PROTOCOLS}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_SWITCHING_PROTOCOLS** = `101`

HTTP status code `101 Switching Protocol`. Sent in response to an
`Upgrade` request header by the client. Indicates the protocol the
server is switching to.

classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_PROCESSING** = `102`

HTTP status code `102 Processing` (WebDAV). Indicates that the server
has received and is processing the request, but no response is available
yet.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_OK}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_OK** = `200`

HTTP status code `200 OK`. The request has succeeded. Default response
for successful requests. Meaning varies depending on the request. GET:
The resource has been fetched and is transmitted in the message body.
HEAD: The entity headers are in the message body. POST: The resource
describing the result of the action is transmitted in the message body.
TRACE: The message body contains the request message as received by the
server.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_CREATED}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_CREATED** = `201`

HTTP status code `201 Created`. The request has succeeded and a new
resource has been created as a result of it. This is typically the
response sent after a PUT request.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_ACCEPTED}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_ACCEPTED** = `202`

HTTP status code `202 Accepted`. The request has been received but not
yet acted upon. It is non-committal, meaning that there is no way in
HTTP to later send an asynchronous response indicating the outcome of
processing the request. It is intended for cases where another process
or server handles the request, or for batch processing.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_NON_AUTHORITATIVE_INFORMATION}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_NON_AUTHORITATIVE_INFORMATION** = `203`

HTTP status code `203 Non-Authoritative Information`. This response code
means returned meta-information set is not exact set as available from
the origin server, but collected from a local or a third party copy.
Except this condition, 200 OK response should be preferred instead of
this response.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_NO_CONTENT}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_NO_CONTENT** = `204`

HTTP status code `204 No Content`. There is no content to send for this
request, but the headers may be useful. The user-agent may update its
cached headers for this resource with the new ones.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_RESET_CONTENT}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_RESET_CONTENT** = `205`

HTTP status code `205 Reset Content`. The server has fulfilled the
request and desires that the client resets the \"document view\" that
caused the request to be sent to its original state as received from the
origin server.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_PARTIAL_CONTENT}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_PARTIAL_CONTENT** = `206`

HTTP status code `206 Partial Content`. This response code is used
because of a range header sent by the client to separate download into
multiple streams.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_MULTI_STATUS}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_MULTI_STATUS** = `207`

HTTP status code `207 Multi-Status` (WebDAV). A Multi-Status response
conveys information about multiple resources in situations where
multiple status codes might be appropriate.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_ALREADY_REPORTED}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_ALREADY_REPORTED** = `208`

HTTP status code `208 Already Reported` (WebDAV). Used inside a DAV:
propstat response element to avoid enumerating the internal members of
multiple bindings to the same collection repeatedly.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_IM_USED}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_IM_USED** = `226`

HTTP status code `226 IM Used` (WebDAV). The server has fulfilled a GET
request for the resource, and the response is a representation of the
result of one or more instance-manipulations applied to the current
instance.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_MULTIPLE_CHOICES}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_MULTIPLE_CHOICES** = `300`

HTTP status code `300 Multiple Choice`. The request has more than one
possible responses and there is no standardized way to choose one of the
responses. User-agent or user should choose one of them.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_MOVED_PERMANENTLY}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_MOVED_PERMANENTLY** = `301`

HTTP status code `301 Moved Permanently`. Redirection. This response
code means the URI of requested resource has been changed. The new URI
is usually included in the response.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_FOUND}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_FOUND** = `302`

HTTP status code `302 Found`. Temporary redirection. This response code
means the URI of requested resource has been changed temporarily. New
changes in the URI might be made in the future. Therefore, this same URI
should be used by the client in future requests.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_SEE_OTHER}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_SEE_OTHER** = `303`

HTTP status code `303 See Other`. The server is redirecting the user
agent to a different resource, as indicated by a URI in the Location
header field, which is intended to provide an indirect response to the
original request.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_NOT_MODIFIED}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_NOT_MODIFIED** = `304`

HTTP status code `304 Not Modified`. A conditional GET or HEAD request
has been received and would have resulted in a 200 OK response if it
were not for the fact that the condition evaluated to `false`.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_USE_PROXY}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_USE_PROXY** = `305`

**Deprecated:** Many clients ignore this response code for security
reasons. It is also deprecated by the HTTP standard.

HTTP status code `305 Use Proxy`.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_SWITCH_PROXY}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_SWITCH_PROXY** = `306`

**Deprecated:** Many clients ignore this response code for security
reasons. It is also deprecated by the HTTP standard.

HTTP status code `306 Switch Proxy`.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_TEMPORARY_REDIRECT}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_TEMPORARY_REDIRECT** = `307`

HTTP status code `307 Temporary Redirect`. The target resource resides
temporarily under a different URI and the user agent MUST NOT change the
request method if it performs an automatic redirection to that URI.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_PERMANENT_REDIRECT}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_PERMANENT_REDIRECT** = `308`

HTTP status code `308 Permanent Redirect`. The target resource has been
assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource
ought to use one of the enclosed URIs.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_BAD_REQUEST}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_BAD_REQUEST** = `400`

HTTP status code `400 Bad Request`. The request was invalid. The server
cannot or will not process the request due to something that is
perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid
request message framing, invalid request contents, or deceptive request
routing).

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_UNAUTHORIZED}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_UNAUTHORIZED** = `401`

HTTP status code `401 Unauthorized`. Credentials required. The request
has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials
for the target resource.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_PAYMENT_REQUIRED}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_PAYMENT_REQUIRED** = `402`

HTTP status code `402 Payment Required`. This response code is reserved
for future use. Initial aim for creating this code was using it for
digital payment systems, however this is not currently used.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_FORBIDDEN}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_FORBIDDEN** = `403`

HTTP status code `403 Forbidden`. The client does not have access rights
to the content, i.e. they are unauthorized, so server is rejecting to
give proper response. Unlike `401`, the client\'s identity is known to
the server.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_NOT_FOUND}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_NOT_FOUND** = `404`

HTTP status code `404 Not Found`. The server can not find requested
resource. Either the URL is not recognized or the endpoint is valid but
the resource itself does not exist. May also be sent instead of 403 to
hide existence of a resource if the client is not authorized.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED** = `405`

HTTP status code `405 Method Not Allowed`. The request\'s HTTP method is
known by the server but has been disabled and cannot be used. For
example, an API may forbid DELETE-ing a resource. The two mandatory
methods, GET and HEAD, must never be disabled and should not return this
error code.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_NOT_ACCEPTABLE}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_NOT_ACCEPTABLE** = `406`

HTTP status code `406 Not Acceptable`. The target resource does not have
a current representation that would be acceptable to the user agent,
according to the proactive negotiation header fields received in the
request. Used when negotiation content.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_PROXY_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_PROXY_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED** = `407`

HTTP status code `407 Proxy Authentication Required`. Similar to 401
Unauthorized, but it indicates that the client needs to authenticate
itself in order to use a proxy.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_REQUEST_TIMEOUT}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_REQUEST_TIMEOUT** = `408`

HTTP status code `408 Request Timeout`. The server did not receive a
complete request message within the time that it was prepared to wait.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_CONFLICT}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_CONFLICT** = `409`

HTTP status code `409 Conflict`. The request could not be completed due
to a conflict with the current state of the target resource. This code
is used in situations where the user might be able to resolve the
conflict and resubmit the request.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_GONE}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_GONE** = `410`

HTTP status code `410 Gone`. The target resource is no longer available
at the origin server and this condition is likely permanent.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_LENGTH_REQUIRED}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_LENGTH_REQUIRED** = `411`

HTTP status code `411 Length Required`. The server refuses to accept the
request without a defined Content-Length header.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_PRECONDITION_FAILED}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_PRECONDITION_FAILED** = `412`

HTTP status code `412 Precondition Failed`. One or more conditions given
in the request header fields evaluated to `false` when tested on the
server.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_REQUEST_ENTITY_TOO_LARGE}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_REQUEST_ENTITY_TOO_LARGE** = `413`

HTTP status code `413 Entity Too Large`. The server is refusing to
process a request because the request payload is larger than the server
is willing or able to process.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_REQUEST_URI_TOO_LONG}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_REQUEST_URI_TOO_LONG** = `414`

HTTP status code `414 Request-URI Too Long`. The server is refusing to
service the request because the request-target is longer than the server
is willing to interpret.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE** = `415`

HTTP status code `415 Unsupported Media Type`. The origin server is
refusing to service the request because the payload is in a format not
supported by this method on the target resource.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_REQUESTED_RANGE_NOT_SATISFIABLE}
::: {.rst-class}
classref-enumeration-constant
:::
::::

`ResponseCode<enum_HTTPClient_ResponseCode>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} **RESPONSE_REQUESTED_RANGE_NOT_SATISFIABLE** = `416`

HTTP status code `416 Requested Range Not Satisfiable`. None of the
ranges in the request\'s Range header field overlap the current extent
of the selected resource or the set of ranges requested has been
rejected due to invalid ranges or an excessive request of small or
overlapping ranges.

:::: {#class_HTTPClient_constant_RESPONSE_EXPECTATION_FAILED}
