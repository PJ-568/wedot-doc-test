# Tutorials and resources {#doc_community_tutorials}

This is a list of third-party tutorials and resources created by the
Godot community. For resources, remember that there is the official
[Godot Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset) full
of official and community resources too! Also, have a look at this [huge
list over at
Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/an0iq5/godot_tutorials_list_of_video_and_written/).

## Where to start

The Godot video tutorials by
[GDQuest](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxboW7x0jZqFdvMdCFKTMsQ/playlists)
are well-regarded in the community and often recommended as a gentle
introduction to beginners.

GDQuest\'s *Learn GDScript From Zero* is a free and open source
interactive tutorial for absolute beginners to learn to program with
Godot\'s GDScript language. It is available as a [desktop
application](https://gdquest.itch.io/learn-godot-gdscript) or [in the
browser](https://gdquest.github.io/learn-gdscript).

Some tutorials mentioned below cover more advanced subjects, e.g. on 3D
or shaders.
