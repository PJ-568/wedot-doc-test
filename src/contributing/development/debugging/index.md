## Debugging the editor

When working on the Godot editor keep in mind that by default the
executable will start in the Project Manager mode. Opening a project
from the Project Manager spawns a new process, which stops the debugging
session. To avoid that you should launch directly into the project using
`-e` and `--path` launch options.

For example, using `gdb` directly, you may do this:

``` none
gdb godot
> run -e --path ~/myproject
```

You can also run the editor directly from your project\'s folder. In
that case, only the `-e` option is required.

``` none
cd ~/myproject
gdb godot
> run -e
```

You can learn more about these launch options and other command line
arguments in the
`command line tutorial <doc_command_line_tutorial>`{.interpreted-text

If you\'re using a code editor or an IDE to debug Godot, check out our
`configuration guides <doc_configuring_an_ide>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, which cover the setup process for building and debugging
with your particular editor.
