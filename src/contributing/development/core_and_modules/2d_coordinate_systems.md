# 2D coordinate systems and 2D transforms {#doc_2d_coordinate_systems}

## Introduction

This is a detailed overview of the available 2D coordinate systems and
2D transforms that are built in. The basic concepts are covered in
`doc_viewport_and_canvas_transforms`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

`Transform2D <class_Transform2D>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} are
matrices that convert coordinates from one coordinate system to an
other. In order to use them, it is beneficial to know which coordinate
systems are available in Godot. For a deeper understanding, the
`doc_matrices_and_transforms`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} tutorial
offers insights to the underlying functionality.

## Godot 2D coordinate systems

The following graphic gives an overview of Godot 2D coordinate systems
and the available node-transforms, transform-functions and
coordinate-system related functions. At the left is the OS Window
Manager screen, at the right are the
`CanvasItems <class_CanvasItem>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. For
simplicity reasons this graphic doesn\'t include
`SubViewport <class_SubViewport>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`SubViewportContainer <class_SubViewportContainer>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, `ParallaxLayer<class_ParallaxLayer>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and
`ParallaxBackground<class_ParallaxBackground>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} all of which also influence transforms.

The graphic is based on a node tree of the following form:
`Root Window (embed Windows)` ⇒ `Window (don't embed Windows)` ⇒
`CanvasLayer` ⇒ `CanvasItem` ⇒ `CanvasItem` ⇒ `CanvasItem`. There are
more complex combinations possible, like deeply nested Window and
SubViewports, however this example intends to provide an overview of the
methodology in general.

  **Item Coordinates**

  :   This is the local coordinate system of a
      `CanvasItem <class_CanvasItem>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

- 

  **Parent Item Coordinates**

  :   This is the local coordinate system of the parent\'s *CanvasItem*.
      When positioning *CanvasItems* in the *Canvas*, they usually
      inherit the transformations of their parent *CanvasItems*. An
      exceptions is
      `CanvasItems.top_level <class_CanvasItem_property_top_level>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"}.

- 

  **Canvas Coordinates**

  :   As mentioned in the previous tutorial
      `doc_canvas_layers`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, there are two
      types of canvases (*Viewport* canvas and *CanvasLayer* canvas) and
      both have a canvas coordinate system. These are also called world
      coordinates. A *Viewport* can contain multiple *Canvases* with
      different coordinate systems.

- 

  **Viewport Coordinates**

  :   This is the coordinate system of the
      `Viewport <class_Viewport>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

- 

  **Camera Coordinates**

  :   This is only used internally for functionality like 3D-camera ray
      projections.

- 

  **Embedder Coordinates / Screen Coordinates**

  :   Every *Viewport* (*Window* or *SubViewport*) in the scene tree is
      embedded either in a different node or in the OS Window Manager.
      This coordinate system\'s origin is identical to the top-left
      corner of the *Window* or *SubViewport* and its scale is the one
      of the embedder or the OS Window Manager.

      If the embedder is the OS Window Manager, then they are also
      called Screen Coordinates.

- 

  **Absolute Embedder Coordinates / Absolute Screen Coordinates**

  :   The origin of this coordinate system is the top-left corner of the
      embedding node or the OS Window Manager screen. Its scale is the
      one of the embedder or the OS Window Manager.

      If the embedder is the OS Window Manager, then they are also
      called Absolute Screen Coordinates.

## Node transforms

Each of the mentioned nodes have one or more transforms associated with
them and the combination of these nodes infer the transforms between the
different coordinate systems. With a few exceptions, the transforms are
`Transform2D <class_Transform2D>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and the
following list shows details and effects of each of them.

- 

  **CanvasItem transform**

  :   *CanvasItems* are either *Control*-nodes or *Node2D*-nodes.

      For *Control* nodes this transform consists of a
      `position <class_Control_property_position>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"} relative to the parent\'s origin and a
      `scale <class_Control_property_scale>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"} and
      `rotation <class_Control_property_rotation>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"} around a
      `pivot point <class_Control_property_pivot_offset>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"}.

      For *Node2D* nodes
      `transform <class_Node2D_property_transform>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"} consists of
      `position <class_Node2D_property_position>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"},
      `rotation <class_Node2D_property_rotation>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"},
      `scale <class_Node2D_property_scale>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"} and
      `skew <class_Node2D_property_skew>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

      The transform affects the item itself and usually also
      child-*CanvasItems* and in the case of a *SubViewportContainer* it
      affects the contained *SubViewport*.

- 

  **CanvasLayer transform**

  :   The *CanvasLayer\'s*
      `transform <class_CanvasLayer_property_transform>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"} affects all *CanvasItems* within the *CanvasLayer*. It
      doesn\'t affect other *CanvasLayers* or *Windows* in its
      *Viewport*.

- 

  **CanvasLayer follow viewport transform**

  :   The *follow viewport transform* is an automatically calculated
      transform, that is based on the *Viewport\'s*
      `canvas transform <class_Viewport_property_canvas_transform>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"} and the *CanvasLayer\'s*
      `follow viewport scale <class_CanvasLayer_property_follow_viewport_scale>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"} and can be used, if
      `enabled <class_CanvasLayer_property_follow_viewport_enabled>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"}, to achieve a pseudo 3D effect. It affects the same
      child nodes as the *CanvasLayer transform*.

- 

  **Viewport canvas transform**

  :   The
      `canvas transform <class_Viewport_property_canvas_transform>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"} affects all *CanvasItems* in the *Viewport\'s* default
      canvas. It also affects *CanvasLayers*, that have follow viewport
      transform enabled. The *Viewport\'s* active
      `Camera2D <class_Camera2D>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} works by
      changing this transform. It doesn\'t affect this *Viewport\'s*
      embedded *Windows*.

- 

  **Viewport global canvas transform**

  :   *Viewports* also have a
      `global canvas transform <class_Viewport_property_global_canvas_transform>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"}. This is the master transform and affects all
      individual *Canvas Layer* and embedded *Window* transforms. This
      is primarily used in Godot\'s CanvasItem Editor.

- 

  **Viewport stretch transform**

  :   Finally, *Viewports* have a *stretch transform*, which is used
      when resizing or stretching the viewport. This transform is used
      for `Windows <class_Window>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} as
      described in `doc_multiple_resolutions`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"}, but can also be manually set on *SubViewports* by
      means of
      `size <class_SubViewport_property_size>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"} and
      `size_2d_override <class_SubViewport_property_size_2d_override>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"}. It\'s
      `translation <class_Transform2D_method_get_origin>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"},
      `rotation <class_Transform2D_method_get_rotation>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"} and
      `skew <class_Transform2D_method_get_skew>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"} are the default values and it can only have
      non-default
      `scale <class_Transform2D_method_get_scale>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"}.

- 

  **Window transform**

  :   In order to scale and position the *Window\'s* content as
      described in `doc_multiple_resolutions`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"}, each `Window <class_Window>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"} contains a *window transform*. It is for example
      responsible for the black bars at the *Window\'s* sides so that
      the *Viewport* is displayed with a fixed aspect ratio.

- 

  **Window position**

  :   Every *Window* also has a
      `position <class_Window_property_position>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"} to describe its position within its embedder. The
      embedder can be another *Viewport* or the OS Window Manager.

- 

  **SubViewportContainer shrink transform**

  :   `stretch <class_SubViewportContainer_property_stretch>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"} together with
      `stretch_shrink <class_SubViewportContainer_property_stretch_shrink>`{.interpreted-text
      role="ref"} declare for a *SubViewportContainer* if and by what
      integer factor the contained *SubViewport* should be scaled in
      comparison to the container\'s size.
