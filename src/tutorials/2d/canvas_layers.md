## Viewport and Canvas items

`CanvasItem <class_CanvasItem>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} is the
base for all 2D nodes, be it regular 2D nodes, such as
`Node2D <class_Node2D>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, or
`Control <class_Control>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. Both inherit
from `CanvasItem <class_CanvasItem>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. You
can arrange canvas items in trees. Each item will inherit its parent\'s
transform: when the parent moves, its children move too.

CanvasItem nodes, and nodes inheriting from them, are direct or indirect
children of a `Viewport <class_Viewport>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
that displays them.

The Viewport\'s property
`Viewport.canvas_transform <class_Viewport_property_canvas_transform>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, allows to apply a custom
`Transform2D <class_Transform2D>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
transform to the CanvasItem hierarchy it contains. Nodes such as
`Camera2D <class_Camera2D>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} work by
changing that transform.

To achieve effects like scrolling, manipulating the canvas transform
property is more efficient than moving the root canvas item and the
entire scene with it.

Usually though, we don\'t want *everything* in the game or app to be
subject to the canvas transform. For example:

- **Parallax Backgrounds**: Backgrounds that move slower than the rest
  of the stage.
- **UI**: Think of a user interface (UI) or head-up display (HUD)
  superimposed on our view of the game world. We want a life counter,
  score display and other elements to retain their screen positions even
  when our view of the game world changes.
- **Transitions**: We may want visual effects used for transitions
  (fades, blends) to remain at a fixed screen location.

How to solve these problems in a single scene tree?

## CanvasLayers

The answer is `CanvasLayer <class_CanvasLayer>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, which is a node that adds a separate 2D rendering layer for
all its children and grand-children. Viewport children will draw by
default at layer \"0\", while a CanvasLayer will draw at any numeric
layer. Layers with a greater number will be drawn above those with a
smaller number. CanvasLayers also have their own transform and do not
depend on the transform of other layers. This allows the UI to be fixed
in screen-space while our view on the game world changes.

An example of this is creating a parallax background. This can be done
with a CanvasLayer at layer \"-1\". The screen with the points, life
counter and pause button can also be created at layer \"1\".

Here\'s a diagram of how it looks:

CanvasLayers are independent of tree order, and they only depend on
their layer number, so they can be instantiated when needed.
