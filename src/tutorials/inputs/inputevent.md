# Using InputEvent {#doc_inputevent}

## What is it?

Managing input is usually complex, no matter the OS or platform. To ease
this a little, a special built-in type is provided,
`InputEvent <class_InputEvent>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. This
datatype can be configured to contain several types of input events.
Input events travel through the engine and can be received in multiple
locations, depending on the purpose.

Here is a quick example, closing your game if the escape key is hit:

:::: {.tabs}
.. code-tab:: gdscript GDScript

func \_unhandled_input(event):

:   

    if event is InputEventKey:

    :   

        if event.pressed and event.keycode == KEY_ESCAPE:

        :   get_tree().quit()

::: {.code-tab}
csharp
:::

public override void \_UnhandledInput(InputEvent @event) { if (@event is
InputEventKey eventKey) if (eventKey.Pressed && eventKey.Keycode ==
Key.Escape) GetTree().Quit(); }
::::

However, it is cleaner and more flexible to use the provided
`InputMap <class_InputMap>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} feature, which
allows you to define input actions and assign them different keys. This
way, you can define multiple keys for the same action (e.g. the keyboard
escape key and the start button on a gamepad). You can then more easily
change this mapping in the project settings without updating your code,
and even build a key mapping feature on top of it to allow your game to
change the key mapping at runtime!

You can set up your InputMap under **Project \> Project Settings \>
Input Map** and then use those actions like this:

:::: {.tabs}
.. code-tab:: gdscript GDScript

func \_process(delta):

:   

    if Input.is_action_pressed(\"ui_right\"):

    :   \# Move right.

::: {.code-tab}
csharp
:::

public override void \_Process(double delta) { if
(Input.IsActionPressed(\"ui_right\")) { // Move right. } }
::::

## How does it work?

Every input event is originated from the user/player (though it\'s
possible to generate an InputEvent and feed them back to the engine,
which is useful for gestures). The DisplayServer for each platform will
read events from the operating system, then feed them to the root
`Window <class_Window>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

The window\'s `Viewport <class_Viewport>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
does quite a lot of stuff with the received input, in order:

![image](img/input_event_flow.webp)

1.  If the Viewport is embedding Windows, the Viewport tries to
    interpret the event in its capability as a Window-Manager (e.g. for
    resizing or moving Windows).
2.  Next if an embedded Window is focused, the event is sent to that
    Window and processed in the Windows Viewport and afterwards treated
    as handled. If no embedded Window is focused, the event is sent to
    the nodes of the current viewport in the following order.
3.  First of all, the standard
    `Node._input() <class_Node_private_method__input>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} function will be called in any node that overrides it
    (and hasn\'t disabled input processing with
    `Node.set_process_input() <class_Node_method_set_process_input>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}). If any function consumes the event, it can call
    `Viewport.set_input_as_handled() <class_Viewport_method_set_input_as_handled>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}, and the event will not spread any more. This ensures
    that you can filter all events of interest, even before the GUI. For
    gameplay input,
    `Node._unhandled_input() <class_Node_private_method__unhandled_input>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} is generally a better fit, because it allows the GUI to
    intercept the events.
4.  Second, it will try to feed the input to the GUI, and see if any
    control can receive it. If so, the
    `Control <class_Control>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} will be
    called via the virtual function
    `Control._gui_input() <class_Control_private_method__gui_input>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} and the signal \"gui_input\" will be emitted (this
    function is re-implementable by script by inheriting from it). If
    the control wants to \"consume\" the event, it will call
    `Control.accept_event() <class_Control_method_accept_event>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} and the event will not spread any more. Use the
    `Control.mouse_filter <class_Control_property_mouse_filter>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} property to control whether a
    `Control <class_Control>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} is notified
    of mouse events via
    `Control._gui_input() <class_Control_private_method__gui_input>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} callback, and whether these events are propagated
    further.
5.  If so far no one consumed the event, the
    `Node._shortcut_input() <class_Node_private_method__shortcut_input>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} callback will be called if overridden (and not disabled
    with
    `Node.set_process_shortcut_input() <class_Node_method_set_process_shortcut_input>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}). This happens only for
    `InputEventKey <class_InputEventKey>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
    `InputEventShortcut <class_InputEventShortcut>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} and
    `InputEventJoypadButton <class_InputEventJoypadButton>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}. If any function consumes the event, it can call
    `Viewport.set_input_as_handled() <class_Viewport_method_set_input_as_handled>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}, and the event will not spread any more. The shortcut
    input callback is ideal for treating events that are intended as
    shortcuts.
6.  If so far no one consumed the event, the
    `Node._unhandled_key_input() <class_Node_private_method__unhandled_key_input>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} callback will be called if overridden (and not disabled
    with
    `Node.set_process_unhandled_key_input() <class_Node_method_set_process_unhandled_key_input>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}). This happens only if the event is an
    `InputEventKey <class_InputEventKey>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
    If any function consumes the event, it can call
    `Viewport.set_input_as_handled() <class_Viewport_method_set_input_as_handled>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}, and the event will not spread any more. The unhandled
    key input callback is ideal for key events.
7.  If so far no one consumed the event, the
    `Node._unhandled_input() <class_Node_private_method__unhandled_input>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} callback will be called if overridden (and not disabled
    with
    `Node.set_process_unhandled_input() <class_Node_method_set_process_unhandled_input>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}). If any function consumes the event, it can call
    `Viewport.set_input_as_handled() <class_Viewport_method_set_input_as_handled>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}, and the event will not spread any more. The unhandled
    input callback is ideal for full-screen gameplay events, so they are
    not received when a GUI is active.
8.  If no one wanted the event so far, and
    `Object Picking <class_viewport_property_physics_object_picking>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} is turned on, the event is used for object picking. For
    the root viewport, this can also be enabled in
    `Project Settings <class_ProjectSettings_property_physics/common/enable_object_picking>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}. In the case of a 3D scene if a
    `Camera3D <class_Camera3D>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} is
    assigned to the Viewport, a ray to the physics world (in the ray
    direction from the click) will be cast. If this ray hits an object,
    it will call the
    `CollisionObject3D._input_event() <class_CollisionObject3D_private_method__input_event>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} function in the relevant physics object. In the case of
    a 2D scene, conceptually the same happens with
    `CollisionObject2D._input_event() <class_CollisionObject2D_private_method__input_event>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.

When sending events to its child and descendant nodes, the viewport will
do so, as depicted in the following graphic, in a reverse depth-first
order, starting with the node at the bottom of the scene tree, and
ending at the root node. Excluded from this process are Windows and
SubViewports.

![image](img/input_event_scene_flow.png)

This order doesn\'t apply to
`Control._gui_input() <class_Control_private_method__gui_input>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, which uses a different method based on event location or
focused Control.

Since Viewports don\'t send events to other
`SubViewports <class_SubViewport>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, one of
the following methods has to be used:

1.  Use a
    `SubViewportContainer <class_SubViewportContainer>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}, which automatically sends events to its child
    `SubViewports <class_SubViewport>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    after
    `Node._input() <class_Node_private_method__input>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} or
    `Control._gui_input() <class_Control_private_method__gui_input>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}.
2.  Implement event propagation based on the individual requirements.

GUI events also travel up the scene tree but, since these events target
specific Controls, only direct ancestors of the targeted Control node
receive the event.

In accordance with Godot\'s node-based design, this enables specialized
child nodes to handle and consume particular events, while their
ancestors, and ultimately the scene root, can provide more generalized
behavior if needed.

## Anatomy of an InputEvent

`InputEvent <class_InputEvent>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} is just a
base built-in type, it does not represent anything and only contains
some basic information, such as event ID (which is increased for each
event), device index, etc.

There are several specialized types of InputEvent, described in the
table below:

|  |  |
|----|----|
| Event | Description |
| `InputEvent <class_InputEvent>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} | Empty Input Event. |
| `InputEventKey <class_InputEventKey>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} | Contains a keycode and Unicode value, as well as modifiers. |
| `InputEventMouseButton <class_InputEventMouseButton>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} | Contains click information, such as button, modifiers, etc. |
| `InputEventMouseMotion <class_InputEventMouseMotion>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} | Contains motion information, such as relative and absolute positions and speed. |
| `InputEventJoypadMotion <class_InputEventJoypadMotion>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} | Contains Joystick/Joypad analog axis information. |
| `InputEventJoypadButton <class_InputEventJoypadButton>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} | Contains Joystick/Joypad button information. |
| `InputEventScreenTouch <class_InputEventScreenTouch>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} | Contains multi-touch press/release information. (only available on mobile devices) |
| `InputEventScreenDrag <class_InputEventScreenDrag>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} | Contains multi-touch drag information. (only available on mobile devices) |
| `InputEventMagnifyGesture <class_InputEventMagnifyGesture>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} | Contains a position, a factor as well as modifiers. |
| `InputEventPanGesture <class_InputEventPanGesture>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} | Contains a position, a delta as well as modifiers. |
| `InputEventMIDI <class_InputEventMIDI>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} | Contains MIDI-related information. |
| `InputEventShortcut <class_InputEventShortcut>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} | Contains a shortcut. |
| `InputEventAction <class_InputEventAction>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} | Contains a generic action. These events are often generated by the programmer as feedback. (more on this below) |

## Actions

Actions are a grouping of zero or more InputEvents into a commonly
understood title (for example, the default \"ui_left\" action grouping
both joypad-left input and a keyboard\'s left arrow key). They are not
required to represent an InputEvent but are useful because they abstract
various inputs when programming the game logic.

This allows for:

- The same code to work on different devices with different inputs
  (e.g., keyboard on PC, Joypad on console).
- Input to be reconfigured at run-time.
- Actions to be triggered programmatically at run-time.

Actions can be created from the Project Settings menu in the **Input
Map** tab and assigned input events.

Any event has the methods
`InputEvent.is_action() <class_InputEvent_method_is_action>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"},
`InputEvent.is_pressed() <class_InputEvent_method_is_pressed>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and `InputEvent <class_InputEvent>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

Alternatively, it may be desired to supply the game back with an action
from the game code (a good example of this is detecting gestures). The
Input singleton has a method for this:
`Input.parse_input_event() <class_input_method_parse_input_event>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. You would normally use it like this:

:::: {.tabs}
.. code-tab:: gdscript GDScript

var ev = InputEventAction.new() \# Set as ui_left, pressed. ev.action =
\"ui_left\" ev.pressed = true \# Feedback. Input.parse_input_event(ev)

::: {.code-tab}
csharp
:::

var ev = new InputEventAction(); // Set as ui_left, pressed. ev.Action =
\"ui_left\"; ev.Pressed = true; // Feedback. Input.ParseInputEvent(ev);
::::

## InputMap

Customizing and re-mapping input from code is often desired. If your
whole workflow depends on actions, the
`InputMap <class_InputMap>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} singleton is
ideal for reassigning or creating different actions at run-time. This
singleton is not saved (must be modified manually) and its state is run
from the project settings (project.godot). So any dynamic system of this
type needs to store settings in the way the programmer best sees fit.
