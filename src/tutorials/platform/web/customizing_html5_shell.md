# Custom HTML page for Web export {#doc_customizing_html5_shell}

While Web export templates provide a default HTML page fully capable of
launching the project without any further customization, it may be
beneficial to create a custom HTML page. While the game itself cannot
easily be directly controlled from the outside yet, such page allows to
customize the initialization process for the engine.

Some use-cases where customizing the default page is useful include:

- Loading files from a different directory than the page;
- Loading a `.zip` file instead of a `.pck` file as the main pack;
- Loading the engine from a different directory than the main pack file;
- Adding a click-to-play button so that games can be started in the
  fullscreen mode;
- Loading some extra files before the engine starts, making them
  available in the project file system as soon as possible;
- Passing custom command line arguments, e.g. `-s` to start a `MainLoop`
  script.

The default HTML page is available in the Godot Engine repository at
[/misc/dist/html/full-size.html](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/misc/dist/html/full-size.html)
but the following template can be used as a much simpler example:

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>My Template</title>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
    </head>
    <body>
        <canvas id="canvas"></canvas>
        <script src="$GODOT_URL"></script>
        <script>
            var engine = new Engine($GODOT_CONFIG);
            engine.startGame();
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

## Setup

As shown by the example above, it is mostly a regular HTML document,
with few placeholders which needs to be replaced during export, an html
`<canvas>` element, and some simple JavaScript code that calls the
`Engine`{.interpreted-text role="js:class"} class.

The only required placeholders are:

- `$GODOT_URL`: The name of the main JavaScript file, which provides the
  `Engine`{.interpreted-text role="js:class"} class required to start
  the engine and that must be included in the HTML as a `<script>`. The
  name is generated from the *Export Path* during the export process.
- `$GODOT_CONFIG`: A JavaScript object, containing the export options
  and can be later overridden. See `EngineConfig`{.interpreted-text
  role="js:attr"} for the full list of overrides.

The following optional placeholders will enable some extra features in
your custom HTML template.

- `$GODOT_PROJECT_NAME`: The project name as defined in the Project
  Settings. It is a good idea to use it as a `<title>` in your template.
- `$GODOT_HEAD_INCLUDE`: A custom string to include in the HTML document
  just before the end of the `<head>` tag. It is customized in the
  export options under the *Html / Head Include* section. While you
  fully control the HTML page you create, this variable can be useful
  for configuring parts of the HTML `head` element from the Godot
  Editor, e.g. for different Web export presets.
- `$GODOT_SPLASH`: Path to an image used as the boot splash as defined
  in the Project Settings.

When the custom page is ready, it can be selected in the export options
under the *Html / Custom Html Shell* section.

## Starting the project

To be able to start the game, you need to write a script that
initializes the engine --- the control code. This process consists of
three steps, but as shown here, most of them can be skipped depending on
how much customization is needed.

See the
`HTML5 shell class reference <doc_html5_shell_classref>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, for the full list of methods and options available.

First, the engine must be loaded, then it needs to be initialized, and
after this the project can finally be started. You can perform every of
these steps manually and with great control. However, in the simplest
case all you need to do is to create an instance of the
`Engine`{.interpreted-text role="js:class"} class with the exported
configuration, and then call the
`engine.startGame <Engine.prototype.startGame>`{.interpreted-text
role="js:meth"} method optionally overriding any
`EngineConfig`{.interpreted-text role="js:attr"} parameters.

``` js
const engine = new Engine($GODOT_CONFIG);
engine.startGame({
    /* optional override configuration, eg. */
    // unloadAfterInit: false,
    // canvasResizePolicy: 0,
    // ...
});
```

This snippet of code automatically loads and initializes the engine
before starting the game. It uses the given configuration to load the
engine. The
`engine.startGame <Engine.prototype.startGame>`{.interpreted-text
role="js:meth"} method is asynchronous and returns a `Promise`. This
allows your control code to track if the game was loaded correctly
without blocking execution or relying on polling.

In case your project needs to have special control over the start
arguments and dependency files, the
`engine.start <Engine.prototype.start>`{.interpreted-text
role="js:meth"} method can be used instead. Note, that this method do
not automatically preload the `pck` file, so you will probably want to
manually preload it (and any other extra file) via the
`engine.preloadFile <Engine.prototype.preloadFile>`{.interpreted-text
role="js:meth"} method.

Optionally, you can also manually
`engine.init <Engine.prototype.init>`{.interpreted-text role="js:meth"}
to perform specific actions after the module initialization, but before
the engine starts.

This process is a bit more complex, but gives you full control over the
engine startup process.

``` js
const myWasm = 'mygame.wasm';
const myPck = 'mygame.pck';
const engine = new Engine();
Promise.all([
    // Load and init the engine
    engine.init(myWasm),
    // And the pck concurrently
    engine.preloadFile(myPck),
]).then(() => {
    // Now start the engine.
    return engine.start({ args: ['--main-pack', myPck] });
}).then(() => {
    console.log('Engine has started!');
});
```

To load the engine manually the `Engine.load`{.interpreted-text
role="js:meth"} static method must be called. As this method is static,
multiple engine instances can be spawned if the share the same `wasm`.

> [!NOTE]
> Multiple instances cannot be spawned by default, as the engine is
> immediately unloaded after it is initialized. To prevent this from
> happening see the `unloadAfterInit`{.interpreted-text role="js:attr"}
> override option. It is still possible to unload the engine manually
> afterwards by calling the `Engine.unload`{.interpreted-text
> role="js:meth"} static method. Unloading the engine frees browser
> memory by unloading files that are no longer needed once the instance
> is initialized.

## Customizing the behavior

In the Web environment several methods can be used to guarantee that the
game will work as intended.

If you target a specific version of WebGL, or just want to check if
WebGL is available at all, you can call the
`Engine.isWebGLAvailable`{.interpreted-text role="js:meth"} method. It
optionally takes an argument that allows to test for a specific major
version of WebGL.

As the real executable file does not exist in the Web environment, the
engine only stores a virtual filename formed from the base name of
loaded engine files. This value affects the output of the
`OS.get_executable_path() <class_OS_method_get_executable_path>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} method and defines the name of the automatically started
main pack. The `executable`{.interpreted-text role="js:attr"} override
option can be used to override this value.

## Customizing the presentation

Several configuration options can be used to further customize the look
and behavior of the game on your page.

By default, the first canvas element on the page is used for rendering.
To use a different canvas element the `canvas`{.interpreted-text
role="js:attr"} override option can be used. It requires a reference to
the DOM element itself.

``` js
const canvasElement = document.querySelector("#my-canvas-element");
engine.startGame({ canvas: canvasElement });
```

The way the engine resize the canvas can be configured via the
`canvasResizePolicy`{.interpreted-text role="js:attr"} override option.

If your game takes some time to load, it may be useful to display a
custom loading UI which tracks the progress. This can be achieved with
the `onProgress`{.interpreted-text role="js:attr"} callback option,
which allows to set up a callback function that will be called regularly
as the engine loads new bytes.

``` js
function printProgress(current, total) {
    console.log("Loaded " + current + " of " + total + " bytes");
}
engine.startGame({ onProgress: printProgress });
```

Be aware that in some cases `total` can be `0`. This means that it
cannot be calculated.

If your game supports multiple languages, the `locale`{.interpreted-text
role="js:attr"} override option can be used to force a specific locale,
provided you have a valid language code string. It may be good to use
server-side logic to determine which languages a user may prefer. This
way the language code can be taken from the `Accept-Language` HTTP
header, or determined by a GeoIP service.

## Debugging

To debug exported projects, it may be useful to read the standard output
and error streams generated by the engine. This is similar to the output
shown in the editor console window. By default, standard `console.log`
and `console.warn` are used for the output and error streams
respectively. This behavior can be customized by setting your own
functions to handle messages.

Use the `onPrint`{.interpreted-text role="js:attr"} override option to
set a callback function for the output stream, and the
`onPrintError`{.interpreted-text role="js:attr"} override option to set
a callback function for the error stream.

``` js
function print(text) {
    console.log(text);
}
function printError(text) {
    console.warn(text);
}
engine.startGame({ onPrint: print, onPrintError: printError });
```

When handling the engine output, keep in mind that it may not be
desirable to print it out in the finished product.
