# Node type customization using name suffixes {#doc_importing_3d_scenes_node_type_customization}

Many times, when editing a scene, there are common tasks that need to be
done after exporting:

- Adding collision detection to objects.
- Setting objects as navigation meshes.
- Deleting nodes that are not used in the game engine (like specific
  lights used for modeling).

To simplify this workflow, Godot offers several suffixes that can be
added to the names of the objects in your 3D modeling software. When
imported, Godot will detect suffixes in object names and will perform
actions automatically.

> [!WARNING]
> All the suffixes described below can be used with `-`, `$`, and `_`
> and are **case-insensitive**.

## Remove nodes (-noimp)

Objects that have the `-noimp` suffix will be removed at import-time no
matter what their type is. They will not appear in the imported scene.

This is equivalent to enabling **Skip Import** for a node in the
Advanced Import Settings dialog.

## Create collisions (-col, -convcol, -colonly, -convcolonly)

The option `-col` will work only for Mesh objects. If it is detected, a
child static collision node will be added, using the same geometry as
the mesh. This will create a triangle mesh collision shape, which is a
slow, but accurate option for collision detection. This option is
usually what you want for level geometry (but see also `-colonly`
below).

The option `-convcol` will create a
`class_ConvexPolygonShape3D`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} instead of a
`class_ConcavePolygonShape3D`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. Unlike
triangle meshes which can be concave, a convex shape can only accurately
represent a shape that doesn\'t have any concave angles (a pyramid is
convex, but a hollow box is concave). Due to this, convex collision
shapes are generally not suited for level geometry. When representing
simple enough meshes, convex collision shapes can result in better
performance compared to a triangle collision shape. This option is ideal
for simple or dynamic objects that require mostly-accurate collision
detection.

However, in both cases, the visual geometry may be too complex or not
smooth enough for collisions. This can create physics glitches and slow
down the engine unnecessarily.

To solve this, the `-colonly` modifier exists. It will remove the mesh
upon importing and will create a `class_StaticBody3D`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} collision instead. This helps the visual mesh and actual
collision to be separated.

The option `-convcolonly` works in a similar way, but will create a
`class_ConvexPolygonShape3D`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} instead using
convex decomposition.

With Collada files, the option `-colonly` can also be used with
Blender\'s empty objects. On import, it will create a
`class_StaticBody3D`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} with a collision node
as a child. The collision node will have one of a number of predefined
shapes, depending on Blender\'s empty draw type:

alt="img/importing_3d_scenes_blender_empty_draw_types.webp" />
<figcaption>Choosing a draw type for an Empty on creation in
Blender</figcaption>
</figure>

- Single arrow will create a
  `class_SeparationRayShape3D`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
- Cube will create a `class_BoxShape3D`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
- Image will create a `class_WorldBoundaryShape3D`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.
- Sphere (and the others not listed) will create a
  `class_SphereShape3D`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

When possible, **try to use a few primitive collision shapes** instead
of triangle mesh or convex shapes. Primitive shapes often have the best
performance and reliability.

## Create Occluder (-occ, -occonly)

If a mesh is imported with the `-occ` suffix an
`class_occluder3D`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} node will be created
based on the geometry of the mesh, it does not replace the mesh. A mesh
node with the `-occonly` suffix will be converted to an
`class_occluder3D`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} on import.

## Create navigation (-navmesh)

A mesh node with the `-navmesh` suffix will be converted to a navigation
mesh. The original Mesh object will be removed at import-time.

## Create a VehicleBody (-vehicle)

A mesh node with the `-vehicle` suffix will be imported as a child to a
`class_VehicleBody3D`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} node.

## Create a VehicleWheel (-wheel)

A mesh node with the `-wheel` suffix will be imported as a child to a
`class_VehicleWheel3D`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} node.

## Rigid Body (-rigid)

A mesh node with the `-rigid` suffix will be imported as a
`class_RigidBody3D`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

## Animation loop (-loop, -cycle)

Animation clips in the source 3D file that start or end with the token
`loop` or `cycle` will be imported as a Godot
`class_Animation`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} with the loop flag set.
**Unlike the other suffixes described above, this does not require a
hyphen.**

In Blender, this requires using the NLA Editor and naming the Action
with the `loop` or `cycle` prefix or suffix.
