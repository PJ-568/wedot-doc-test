# Controlling thousands of fish with Particles {#doc_controlling_thousands_of_fish}

The problem with
`MeshInstance3D <class_MeshInstance3D>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} is
that it is expensive to update their transform array. It is great for
placing many static objects around the scene. But it is still difficult
to move the objects around the scene.

To make each instance move in an interesting way, we will use a
`GPUParticles3D <class_GPUParticles3D>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
node. Particles take advantage of GPU acceleration by computing and
setting the per-instance information in a
`Shader <class_Shader>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

First create a Particles node. Then, under \"Draw Passes\" set the
Particle\'s \"Draw Pass 1\" to your
`Mesh <class_Mesh>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. Then under \"Process
Material\" create a new
`ShaderMaterial <class_ShaderMaterial>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

Set the `shader_type` to `particles`.

``` glsl
shader_type particles
```

Then add the following two functions:

``` glsl
float rand_from_seed(in uint seed) {
  int k;
  int s = int(seed);
  if (s == 0)
    s = 305420679;
  k = s / 127773;
  s = 16807 * (s - k * 127773) - 2836 * k;
  if (s < 0)
    s += 2147483647;
  seed = uint(s);
  return float(seed % uint(65536)) / 65535.0;
}

uint hash(uint x) {
  x = ((x >> uint(16)) ^ x) * uint(73244475);
  x = ((x >> uint(16)) ^ x) * uint(73244475);
  x = (x >> uint(16)) ^ x;
  return x;
}
```

These functions come from the default
`ParticleProcessMaterial <class_ParticleProcessMaterial>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}. They are used to generate a random number from each
particle\'s `RANDOM_SEED`.

A unique thing about particle shaders is that some built-in variables
are saved across frames. `TRANSFORM`, `COLOR`, and `CUSTOM` can all be
accessed in the shader of the mesh, and also in the particle shader the
next time it is run.

Next, setup your `start()` function. Particles shaders contain a
`start()` function and a `process()` function.

The code in the `start()` function only runs when the particle system
starts. The code in the `process()` function will always run.

We need to generate 4 random numbers: 3 to create a random position and
one for the random offset of the swim cycle.

First, generate 4 seeds inside the `start()` function using the `hash()`
function provided above:

``` glsl
uint alt_seed1 = hash(NUMBER + uint(1) + RANDOM_SEED);
uint alt_seed2 = hash(NUMBER + uint(27) + RANDOM_SEED);
uint alt_seed3 = hash(NUMBER + uint(43) + RANDOM_SEED);
uint alt_seed4 = hash(NUMBER + uint(111) + RANDOM_SEED);
```

Then, use those seeds to generate random numbers using `rand_from_seed`:

``` glsl
CUSTOM.x = rand_from_seed(alt_seed1);
vec3 position = vec3(rand_from_seed(alt_seed2) * 2.0 - 1.0,
                     rand_from_seed(alt_seed3) * 2.0 - 1.0,
                     rand_from_seed(alt_seed4) * 2.0 - 1.0);
```

Finally, assign `position` to `TRANSFORM[3].xyz`, which is the part of
the transform that holds the position information.

``` glsl
TRANSFORM[3].xyz = position * 20.0;
```

Remember, all this code so far goes inside the `start()` function.

The vertex shader for your mesh can stay the exact same as it was in the
previous tutorial.

Now you can move each fish individually each frame, either by adding to
the `TRANSFORM` directly or by writing to `VELOCITY`.

Let\'s transform the fish by setting their `VELOCITY` in the `start()`
function.

``` glsl
VELOCITY.z = 10.0;
```

This is the most basic way to set `VELOCITY` every particle (or fish)
will have the same velocity.

Just by setting `VELOCITY` you can make the fish swim however you want.
For example, try the code below.

``` glsl
VELOCITY.z = cos(TIME + CUSTOM.x * 6.28) * 4.0 + 6.0;
```

This will give each fish a unique speed between `2` and `10`.

You can also let each fish change its velocity over time if you set the
velocity in the `process()` function.

If you used `CUSTOM.y` in the last tutorial, you can also set the speed
of the swim animation based on the `VELOCITY`. Just use `CUSTOM.y`.

``` glsl
CUSTOM.y = VELOCITY.z * 0.1;
```

This code gives you the following behavior:

Using a ParticleProcessMaterial you can make the fish behavior as simple
or complex as you like. In this tutorial we only set Velocity, but in
your own Shaders you can also set `COLOR`, rotation, scale (through
`TRANSFORM`). Please refer to the
`Particles Shader Reference <doc_particle_shader>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for more information on particle shaders.
