To get started with particles, the first thing we need to do is add a
`GPUParticles3D` node to the scene. Before we can actually see any
particles, we have to set up two parameters on the node: the
`Process Material` and at least one `Draw Pass`.

## The process material

To add a process material to your particles node, go to
`Process Material` in the inspector panel. Click on the box next to
`Process Material` and from the dropdown menu select
`New ParticleProcessMaterial`.

</figure>

`class_ParticleProcessMaterial`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} is a
special kind of material. We don\'t use it to draw any objects. We use
it to update particle data and behavior on the GPU instead of the CPU,
which comes with a massive performance boost. A click on the newly added
material displays a long list of properties that you can set to control
each particle\'s behavior.

## Draw passes

<figcaption>At least one draw pass is required</figcaption>
</figure>

In order to render any particles, at least one draw pass needs to be
defined. To do that, go to `Draw Passes` in the inspector panel. Click
on the box next to `Pass 1` and select `New QuadMesh` from the dropdown
menu. After that, click on the mesh and set its `Size` to 0.1 for both
`x` and `y`. Reducing the mesh\'s size makes it a little easier to tell
the individual particle meshes apart at this stage.

You can use up to 4 draw passes per particle system. Each pass can
render a different mesh with its own unique material. All draw passes
use the data that is computed by the process material, which is an
efficient method for composing complex effects: Compute particle
behavior once and feed it to multiple render passes.

blue spheres (pass 2)</figcaption>

If you followed the steps above, your particle system should now be
emitting particles in a waterfall-like fashion, making them move
downwards and disappear after a few seconds. This is the foundation for
all particle effects. Take a look at the documentation for
`particle <doc_3d_particles_properties>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
and
`particle material <doc_process_material_properties>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} properties to learn how to make particle effects more
interesting.

## Particle conversion

</figure>

You can convert GPU particles to CPU particles at any time using the
entry in the viewport menu. When you do so, keep in mind that not every
feature of GPU particles is available for CPU particles, so the
resulting particle system will look and behave differently from the
original.

You can also convert CPU particles to GPU particles if you no longer
need to use CPU particles. This is also done from the viewport menu.

Some of the most notable features that are lost during the conversion
include:

- multiple draw passes
- turbulence
- sub-emitters
- trails
- attractors
- collision

You also lose the following properties:

- `Amount Ratio`
- `Interp to End`
- `Damping as Friction`
- `Emission Shape Offset`
- `Emission Shape Scale`
- `Inherit Velocity Ratio`
- `Velocity Pivot`
- `Directional Velocity`
- `Radial Velocity`
- `Velocity Limit`
- `Scale Over Velocity`

Converting GPU particles to CPU particles can become necessary when you
want to release a game on older devices that don\'t support modern
graphics APIs.
