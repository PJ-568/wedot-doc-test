# Introduction to 3D {#doc_introduction_to_3d}

Creating a 3D game can be challenging. That extra Z coordinate makes
many of the common techniques that helped to make 2D games simpler no
longer work. To aid in this transition, it is worth mentioning that
Godot uses similar APIs for 2D and 3D. Most nodes are the same and are
present in both 2D and 3D versions. In fact, it is worth checking the 3D
platformer tutorial, or the 3D kinematic character tutorials, which are
almost identical to their 2D counterparts.

In 3D, math is a little more complex than in 2D, so also checking the
`doc_vector_math`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} entry in the wiki (which
was especially created for game developers, not mathematicians or
engineers) will help pave the way for you to develop 3D games
efficiently.

## 3D workspace {#d-workspace}

Editing 3D scenes is done in the 3D workspace. This workspace can be
selected manually, but it will be automatically selected when a Node3D
node is selected.

![image](img/tuto_3d3.webp)

Similar to 2D, the tabs below the workspace selector are used to change
between currently opened scenes or create a new one using the plus (+)
button. The left and right docks should be familiar from
`editor introduction <doc_editor_introduction>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

Below the scene selector, the main toolbar is visible, and beneath the
main toolbar is the 3D viewport.

### Main toolbar

Some buttons in the main toolbar are the same as those in the 2D
workspace. A brief explanation is given with the shortcut if the mouse
cursor is hovered over a button for one second. Some buttons may have
additional functionality if another keypress is performed. A recap of
main functionality of each button with its default shortcut is provided
below from left to right:

![image](img/3d_toolbar.webp)

- **Select Mode** (`Q`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"}): Allows selection
  of nodes in the viewport. Left clicking on a node to select one. Left
  clicking and dragging a rectangle selects all nodes within the
  rectangle\'s boundaries, once released. Holding
  `Shift`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"} while selecting adds more nodes
  to the selection. Clicking on a selected node while holding
  `Shift`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"} deselects the node. In this
  mode, you can use the gizmos to perform movement or rotation.

- **Move Mode** (`W`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"}): Enables move (or
  translate) mode for the selected nodes. See
  `doc_introduction_to_3d_space_and_manipulation`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} for more details.

- **Rotate Mode** (`E`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"}): Enables rotation
  mode for the selected nodes. See
  `doc_introduction_to_3d_space_and_manipulation`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} for more details.

- **Scale Mode** (`R`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"}): Enables scaling
  and displays scaling gizmos in different axes for the selected nodes.
  See `doc_introduction_to_3d_space_and_manipulation`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} for more details.

- **Show the list of selectable nodes at the clicked position**: As the
  description suggests, this provides a list of selectable nodes at the
  clicked position as a context menu, if there is more than one node in
  the clicked area.

- **Lock** (`Ctrl + L`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"}) the selected
  nodes, preventing selection and movement in the viewport. Clicking the
  button again (or using `Ctrl + Shift + L`{.interpreted-text
  role="kbd"}) unlocks the selected nodes. Locked nodes can only be
  selected in the scene tree. They can easily be identified with a
  padlock next to their node names in the scene tree. Clicking on this
  padlock also unlocks the nodes.

- **Group selected nodes** (`Ctrl + G`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"}).
  This allows selection of the root node if any of the children are
  selected. Using `Ctrl + G`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"} ungroups
  them. Additionally, clicking the ungroup button in the scene tree
  performs the same action.

- **Use Local Space** (`T`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"}): If enabled,
  gizmos of a node are drawn using the current node\'s rotation angle
  instead of the
  `global viewport axes <doc_introduction_to_3d_coordinate_system>`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"}.

- **Use Snap** (`Y`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"}): If enabled,
  movement, and rotation snap to grid. Snapping can also temporarily be
  activated using `Ctrl`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"} while performing
  the action. The settings for changing snap options are explained
  below.

- **Project Camera Override**: This action temporarily replaces the
  active camera in the level (e.g., the camera following the player)
  with the camera in the editor\'s viewport, allowing you to move freely
  and inspect the level\'s different parts, while game is running.

- **Toggle preview sunlight**: If no DirectionalLight3D exist in the
  scene, a preview of sunlight can be used as a light source. See
  `doc_introduction_to_3d_preview_environment_light`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} for more details.

- **Toggle preview environment**: If no WorldEnvironment exists in the
  scene, a preview of the environment can be used as a placeholder. See
  `doc_introduction_to_3d_preview_environment_light`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} for more details.

- **Edit Sun and Environment Settings (three dots)**: Opens the menu to
  configure preview sunlight and environment settings. See
  `doc_introduction_to_3d_preview_environment_light`{.interpreted-text
  role="ref"} for more details.

- **Transform menu**: It has three options:

  > - *Snap Object to Floor*: Snaps an object to a solid floor.
  > - *Transform Dialog*: Opens a dialog to adjust transform parameters
  >   (translate, rotate, scale, and transform) manually.
  > - *Snap Settings*: Allows you to change transform, rotate snap (in
  >   degrees), and scale snap (in percent) settings.

- **View menu**: Controls the view options and enables additional
  viewports:

![image](img/tuto_3d6.webp)

In this menu, you can also show/hide grids, which are set to 1x1 meter
by default, and the origin, where the blue, green, and red axis lines
intersect. Moreover, specific types of gizmos can be toggled in this
menu.

![image](img/tuto_3d6_2.webp)

An open eye means that the gizmo is visible, a closed eye means it is
hidden. A half-open eye means that it is also visible through opaque
surfaces.

Clicking on *Settings* in this view menu opens a window to change the
*Vertical Field of View (VFOV)* parameter (in degrees), *Z-Near*, and
*Z-Far* values.

Next to the View menu, additional buttons may be visible. In the toolbar
image at the beginning of this chapter, an additional *Mesh* button
appears because a MeshInstance3D is selected. This menu provides some
quick actions or tools to work on a specific node or selection.

### View menu of viewport

Below the *Select* tool, in the 3D viewport, clicking on the three dots
opens the **View menu** for the viewport. Hiding all shown gizmos in the
editor\'s 3D view can also be performed through this menu:

![image](img/tuto_3d6_1.webp)

This menu also displays the current view type and enables quick
adjustment of the viewport\'s viewing angle. Additionally, it offers
options to modify the appearance of nodes within the viewport.

### Coordinate system {#doc_introduction_to_3d_coordinate_system}

Godot uses the [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system)
system for everything in 3D, with 1 unit being equal to 1 meter. Physics
and other areas are tuned for this scale. Therefore, attempting to use a
different scale is usually a bad idea (unless you know what you are
doing).

When working with 3D assets, it\'s always best to work in the correct
scale (set the unit to metric in your 3D modeling software). Godot
allows scaling post-import and, while this works in most cases, in rare
situations it may introduce floating-point precision issues (and thus,
glitches or artifacts) in delicate areas such as rendering or physics.
Make sure your artists always work in the right scale!

The Y coordinate is used for \"up\". As for the horizontal X/Z axes,
Godot uses a **right-handed** coordinate system. This means that for
most objects that need alignment (such as lights or cameras), the Z axis
is used as a \"pointing towards\" direction. This convention roughly
means that:

- **X** is sides
- **Y** is up/down
- **Z** is front/back

See this chart for comparison with other 3D software:

</figure>

### Space and manipulation gizmos {#doc_introduction_to_3d_space_and_manipulation}

Moving, rotating, and scaling objects in the 3D view is done through the
manipulator gizmos. Each axis is represented by a color: Red, Green,
Blue represent X, Y, Z respectively. This convention applies to the grid
and other gizmos too (and also to the shader language, ordering of
components for Vector3, Color, etc.).

![image](img/tuto_3d5.webp)

Some useful keybindings:

- To snap placement or rotation, press `Ctrl`{.interpreted-text
  role="kbd"} while moving, scaling, or rotating.
- To center the view on the selected object, press `F`{.interpreted-text
  role="kbd"}.

In the viewport, the arrows can be clicked and held to move the object
on an axis. The arcs can be clicked and held to rotate the object. To
lock one axis and move the object freely in the other two axes, the
colored rectangles can be clicked, held, and dragged.

If the transform mode is changed from *Select Mode* to *Scale Mode*, the
arrows will be replaced by cubes, which can be dragged to scale an
object as if the object is being moved.

### Navigating the 3D environment

In 3D environments, it is often important to adjust the viewpoint or
angle from which you are viewing the scene. In Godot, navigating the 3D
environment in the viewport (or spatial editor) can be done in multiple
ways.

The default 3D scene navigation controls are similar to Blender (aiming
to have some sort of consistency in the free software pipeline), but
options are included to customize mouse buttons and behavior to be
similar to other tools in the Editor Settings. To change the controls to
Maya or Modo controls, you can navigate to **Editor Settings \> Editors
\> 3D**. Then, under *Navigation*, search for *Navigation Scheme*.

![image](img/tuto_3d4.webp)

Using the default settings, the following shortcuts control how one can
navigate in the viewport:

Pressing the middle mouse button and dragging the mouse allows you to
orbit around the center of what is on the screen.

It is also possible to left-click and hold the manipulator gizmo located
on the top right of the viewport to orbit around the center:

![image](img/tuto_3d_gizmo.webp)

Left-clicking on one of the colored circles will set the view to the
chosen orthogonal and the viewport\'s view menu will be updated
accordingly.

![image](img/tuto_3d_updated_view_menu.webp)

If the *Perspective* view is enabled on the viewport (can be seen on the
viewport\'s View menu, not the View menu on the main toolbar), holding
down the right mouse button on the viewport or pressing
`Shift + F`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"} switches to \"free-look\"
mode. In this mode you can move the mouse to look around, use the
`W`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"} `A`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"}
`S`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"} `D`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"} keys
to fly around the view, `E`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"} to go up, and
`Q`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"} to go down. To disable this mode,
release the right mouse button or press `Shift + F`{.interpreted-text
role="kbd"} again.

In the free-look mode, you can temporarily increase the flying speed
using `Shift`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"} or decrease it using
`Alt`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"}. To change and keep the speed
modifier use `mouse wheel up`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"} or
`mouse wheel down`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"}, to increase or
decrease it, respectively.

In orthogonal mode, holding the right mouse button will pan the view
instead. Use `Keypad 5`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"} to toggle between
perspective and orthogonal view.

### Using Blender-style transform shortcuts

Since Godot 4.2, you can enable Blender-style shortcuts for translating,
rotating and scaling nodes. In Blender, these shortcuts are:

- `G`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"} for translating
- `R`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"} for rotating
- `S`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"} for scaling

After pressing a shortcut key while focusing on the 3D editor viewport,
move the mouse or enter a number to move the selected node(s) by the
specified amount in 3D units. You can constrain movement to a specific
axis by specifying the axis as a letter, then the distance (if entering
a value with the keyboard).

For instance, to move the selection upwards by 2.5 units, enter the
following sequence in order (Y+ is upwards in Godot):

`G`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"}-`Y`{.interpreted-text
role="kbd"}-`2`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"}-`.`{.interpreted-text
role="kbd"}-`5`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"}-`Enter`{.interpreted-text
role="kbd"}

To use Blender-style transform shortcuts in Godot, go to the Editor
Settings\' **Shortcuts** tab, then in the Spatial Editor section:

- Bind **Begin Translate Transformation** to `G`{.interpreted-text
  role="kbd"}.
- Bind **Begin Rotate Transformation** to `R`{.interpreted-text
  role="kbd"}.
- Bind **Begin Scale Transformation** to `S`{.interpreted-text
  role="kbd"}.
- Finally, unbind **Scale Mode** so that its shortcut won\'t conflict
  with **Begin Rotate Transformation**.

> `doc_default_key_mapping_shortcuts_spatial_editor`{.interpreted-text
> role="ref"} page.

## Node3D node

`Node2D <class_Node2D>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} is the base node
for 2D. `Control <class_Control>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} is the
base node for everything GUI. Following this reasoning, the 3D engine
uses the `Node3D <class_Node3D>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} node for
everything 3D.

![image](img/tuto_3d1.webp)

Node3Ds have a local transform, which is relative to the parent node (as
long as the parent node is also of **or inherits from** the type
Node3D). This transform can be accessed as a 3×4
`Transform3D <class_Transform3D>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, or as 3
`Vector3 <class_Vector3>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} members
representing location, Euler rotation (X, Y and Z angles) and scale.

![image](img/tuto_3d2.webp)

## 3D content {#d-content}

Unlike 2D, where loading image content and drawing is straightforward,
3D is a little more difficult. The content needs to be created with
special 3D tools (also called Digital Content Creation tools, or DCCs)
and exported to an exchange file format to be imported in Godot. This is
required since 3D formats are not as standardized as images.

### Manually authored models (using 3D modeling software)

It is possible to import 3D models in Godot created in external tools.
Depending on the format, you can import entire scenes (exactly as they
look in the 3D modeling software), including animation, skeletal rigs,
blend shapes, or as simple resources.

::: {.seealso}
See `doc_importing_3d_scenes`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for more on
importing.

### Generated geometry

It is possible to create custom geometry by using the
`ArrayMesh <class_ArrayMesh>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} resource
directly. Simply create your arrays and use the
`ArrayMesh.add_surface_from_arrays() <class_ArrayMesh_method_add_surface_from_arrays>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} function. A helper class is also available,
`SurfaceTool <class_SurfaceTool>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, which
provides a more straightforward API and helpers for indexing, generating
normals, tangents, etc.

In any case, this method is meant for generating static geometry (models
that will not be updated often), as creating vertex arrays and
submitting them to the 3D API has a significant performance cost.

> [!NOTE]
> To learn about prototyping inside Godot or using external tools, see
> `doc_csg_tools`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

### Immediate geometry

If, instead, you need to generate simple geometry that will be updated
often, Godot provides a special
`ImmediateMesh <class_ImmediateMesh>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
resource that can be used in a
`MeshInstance3D <class_MeshInstance3D>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
node. This provides an OpenGL 1.x-style immediate-mode API to create
points, lines, triangles, etc.

### 2D in 3D {#d-in-3d}

While Godot packs a powerful 2D engine, many types of games use 2D in a
3D environment. By using a fixed camera (either orthogonal or
perspective) that does not rotate, nodes such as
`Sprite3D <class_Sprite3D>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
`AnimatedSprite3D <class_AnimatedSprite3D>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} can be used to create 2D games that take advantage of mixing
with 3D backgrounds, more realistic parallax, lighting/shadow effects,
etc.

The disadvantage is, of course, that added complexity and reduced
performance in comparison to plain 2D, as well as the lack of reference
of working in pixels.

## Environment

Besides editing a scene, it is often common to edit the environment.
Godot provides a
`WorldEnvironment <class_WorldEnvironment>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} node that allows changing the background color, mode (as in,
put a skybox), and applying several types of built-in post-processing
effects. Environments can also be overridden in the Camera.

### Preview environment and light {#doc_introduction_to_3d_preview_environment_light}

By default, any 3D scene that doesn\'t have a
`WorldEnvironment <class_WorldEnvironment>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} node, or a
`DirectionalLight3D <class_DirectionalLight3D>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, will have a preview turned on for what it\'s missing to
light the scene.

The preview light and environment will only be visible in the scene
while in the editor. If you run the scene or export the project they
will not affect the scene.

The preview light and environment can be turned on or off from the top
menu by clicking on their respective icon.

![image](img/tuto_3d8.webp)

The three dots dropdown menu next to those icons can be used to adjust
the properties of the preview environment and light if they are enabled.

![image](img/tuto_3d9.webp)

The same preview sun and environment is used for every scene in the same
project, So only make adjustments that would apply to all of the scenes
you will need a preview light and environment for.

### Cameras

No matter how many objects are placed in the 3D space, nothing will be
displayed unless a `Camera3D <class_Camera3D>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} is also added to the scene. Cameras can work in either
orthogonal or perspective projections:

![image](img/tuto_3d10.webp)

Cameras are associated with (and only display to) a parent or
grandparent viewport. Since the root of the scene tree is a viewport,
cameras will display on it by default, but if sub-viewports (either as
render target or picture-in-picture) are desired, they need their own
children cameras to display.

![image](img/tuto_3d11.png)

When dealing with multiple cameras, the following rules are enforced for
each viewport:

- If no cameras are present in the scene tree, the first one that enters
  it will become the active camera. Further cameras entering the scene
  will be ignored (unless they are set as *current*).
- If a camera has the \"\*current\*\" property set, it will be used
  regardless of any other camera in the scene. If the property is set,
  it will become active, replacing the previous camera.
- If an active camera leaves the scene tree, the first camera in
  tree-order will take its place.

### Lights

The background environment emits some ambient light which appears on
surfaces. Still, without any light sources placed in the scene, the
scene will appear quite dark unless the background environment is very
bright.

Most outdoor scenes have a directional light (the sun or moon), while
indoor scenes typically have several positional lights (lamps, torches,
...). See `doc_lights_and_shadows`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for
more information on setting up lights in Godot.
