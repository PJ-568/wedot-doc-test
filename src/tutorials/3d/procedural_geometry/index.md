# Procedural geometry {#doc_procedural_geometry}

There are many ways to procedurally generate geometry in Godot. In this
tutorial series, we will explore a few of them. Each technique has its
own benefits and drawbacks, so it is best to understand each one and how
it can be useful in a given situation.

## What is geometry?

Geometry is a fancy way of saying shape. In computer graphics, geometry
is typically represented by an array of positions called \"vertices\".
In Godot, geometry is represented by Meshes.

## What is a Mesh?

Many things in Godot have mesh in their name: the
`Mesh <class_Mesh>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, the
`ArrayMesh <class_ArrayMesh>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, the
`ImmediateMesh
<class_ImmediateMesh>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, the
`MeshInstance3D <class_MeshInstance3D>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
the `MultiMesh <class_MultiMesh>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and the
`MultiMeshInstance3D
<class_MultiMeshInstance3D>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. While they
are all related, they have slightly different uses.

Meshes and ArrayMeshes are resources that are drawn using a
MeshInstance3D node. Resources like Meshes and ArrayMeshes cannot be
added to the scene directly. A MeshInstance3D represents one instance of
a mesh in your scene. You can reuse a single mesh in multiple
MeshInstance3Ds to draw it in different parts of your scene with
different materials or transformations (scale, rotation, position etc.).

If you are going to draw the same object many times, it can be helpful
to use a MultiMesh with a MultiMeshInstance3D. MultiMeshInstance3Ds draw
meshes thousands of times very cheaply by taking advantage of hardware
instancing. The drawback with using a MultiMeshInstance3D is that each
of your mesh\'s surfaces are limited to one material for all instances.
It uses an instance array to store different colors and transformations
for each instance, but all the instances of each surface use the same
material.

## What a Mesh is

A Mesh is composed of one or more surfaces. A surface is an array
composed of multiple sub-arrays containing vertices, normals, UVs, etc.
Normally the process of constructing surfaces and meshes is hidden from
the user in the
`RenderingServer <class_RenderingServer>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
but with ArrayMeshes, the user can construct a Mesh manually by passing
in an array containing the surface information.

### Surfaces

Each surface has its own material. Alternatively, you can override the
material for all surfaces in the Mesh when you use a MeshInstance3D
using the
`material_override <class_GeometryInstance3D_property_material_override>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} property.

### Surface array

The surface array is an array of length `ArrayMesh.ARRAY_MAX`. Each
position in the array is filled with a sub-array containing per-vertex
information. For example, the array located at `ArrayMesh.ARRAY_NORMAL`
is a `PackedVector3Array <class_PackedVector3Array>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} of vertex normals. See
`Mesh.ArrayType <enum_Mesh_ArrayType>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for
more information.

The surface array can be indexed or non-indexed. Creating a non-indexed
array is as easy as not assigning an array at the index
`ArrayMesh.ARRAY_INDEX`. A non-indexed array stores unique vertex
information for every triangle, meaning that when two triangles share a
vertex, the vertex is duplicated in the array. An indexed surface array
only stores vertex information for each unique vertex and then also
stores an array of indices which maps out how to construct the triangles
from the vertex array. In general, using an indexed array is faster, but
it means you have to share vertex data between triangles, which is not
always desired (e.g. when you want per-face normals).

## Tools

Godot provides different ways of accessing and working with geometry.
More information on each will be provided in the following tutorials.

### ArrayMesh

The ArrayMesh resource extends Mesh to add a few different quality of
life functions and, most importantly, the ability to construct a Mesh
surface through scripting.

For more information about the ArrayMesh, please see the
`ArrayMesh tutorial <doc_arraymesh>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

### MeshDataTool

The MeshDataTool is a resource that converts Mesh data into arrays of
vertices, faces, and edges that can be modified at runtime.

For more information about the MeshDataTool, please see the
`MeshDataTool tutorial <doc_meshdatatool>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

### SurfaceTool

The SurfaceTool allows the creation of Meshes using an OpenGL 1.x
immediate mode style interface.

For more information about the SurfaceTool, please see the
`SurfaceTool tutorial <doc_surfacetool>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

### ImmediateMesh

ImmediateMesh is a mesh that uses an immediate mode style interface
(like SurfaceTool) to draw objects. The difference between ImmediateMesh
and the SurfaceTool is that ImmediateMesh is drawn directly with code
dynamically, while the SurfaceTool is used to generate a Mesh that you
can do whatever you want with.

ImmediateMesh is useful for prototyping because of its straightforward
API, but it is slow because the geometry is rebuilt each time you make a
change. It is most useful for adding simple geometry for visual
debugging (e.g. by drawing lines to visualize physics raycasts etc.).

For more information about ImmediateMesh, please see the
`ImmediateMesh tutorial <doc_immediatemesh>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

## Which one should I use?

Which approach you use depends on what you are trying to do and what
kind of procedure you are comfortable with.

Both SurfaceTool and ArrayMesh are excellent for generating static
geometry (meshes) that don\'t change over time.

Using an ArrayMesh is slightly faster than using a SurfaceTool, but the
API is a little more challenging. Additionally, SurfaceTool has a few
quality of life methods such as `generate_normals()` and `index()`.

ImmediateMesh is more limited than both ArrayMesh and SurfaceTool.
However, if you need the geometry to change every frame anyway, it
provides a much easier interface that can be slightly faster than
generating an ArrayMesh every frame.

The MeshDataTool is not fast, but it gives you access to all kinds of
properties of the mesh that you don\'t get with the others (edges,
faces, etc.). It is incredibly useful when you need that sort of data to
transform the mesh, but it is not a good idea to use it if that extra
information is not needed. The MeshDataTool is best used if you are
going to be using an algorithm that requires access to the face or edge
array.
