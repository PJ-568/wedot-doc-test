# TLS/SSL certificates {#doc_ssl_certificates}

## Introduction

It is often desired to use
`TLS (Transport Layer Security)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
connections (also known as
`SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} connections)
for communications to avoid \"man in the middle\" attacks. Godot has a
connection wrapper,
`StreamPeerTLS <class_StreamPeerTLS>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
which can take a regular connection and add security around it. The
`HTTPClient <class_HTTPClient>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
`HTTPRequest <class_HTTPRequest>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} classes
also support HTTPS using this same wrapper.

Godot will try to use the TLS certificate bundle provided by the
operating system, but also includes the [TLS certificate bundle from
Mozilla](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/thirdparty/certs/ca-certificates.crt)
as a fallback.

You can alternatively force your own certificate bundle in the Project
Settings:

<figure class="align-center">
<img src="img/tls_certificates_project_setting.webp"
alt="img/tls_certificates_project_setting.webp" />
<figcaption>Setting the TLS certificate bundle override project
setting</figcaption>
</figure>

When set, this file *overrides* the operating system provided bundle by
default. This file should contain any number of public certificates in
[PEM
format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-enhanced_Electronic_Mail).

There are two ways to obtain certificates:

## Obtain a certificate from a certificate authority

The main approach to getting a certificate is to use a certificate
authority (CA) such as [Let\'s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). This
is a more cumbersome process than a self-signed certificate, but it\'s
more \"official\" and ensures your identity is clearly represented. The
resulting certificate is also trusted by applications such as web
browsers, unlike a self-signed certificate which requires additional
configuration on the client side before it\'s considered trusted.

These certificates do not require any configuration on the client to
work, since Godot already bundles the Mozilla certificate bundle in the
editor and exported projects.

## Generate a self-signed certificate

For most use cases, it\'s recommended to go through certificate
authority as the process is free with certificate authorities such as
Let\'s Encrypt. However, if using a certificate authority is not an
option, then you can generate a self-signed certificate and tell the
client to consider your self-signed certificate as trusted.

To create a self-signed certificate, generate a private and public key
pair and add the public key (in PEM format) to the CRT file specified in
the Project Settings.

> [!WARNING]
> When specifying a self-signed certificate as TLS bundle in the project
> settings, normal domain name validation is enforced via the
> certificate `CN (common name)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} and
> alternative names. See
> `TLSOptions <class_TLSOptions>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to

For development purposes Godot can generate self-signed certificates via
`Crypto.generate_self_signed_certificate
<class_Crypto_method_generate_self_signed_certificate>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

Alternatively, OpenSSL has some documentation about [generating
keys](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openssl/openssl/master/doc/HOWTO/keys.txt)
and
[certificates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openssl/openssl/master/doc/HOWTO/certificates.txt).
