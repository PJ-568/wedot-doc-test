# Exporting for macOS {#doc_exporting_for_macos}

::: {.seealso}
This page describes how to export a Godot project to macOS. If you\'re
looking to compile editor or export template binaries from source
instead, read `doc_compiling_for_macos`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
:::

macOS apps exported with the official export templates are exported as a
single \"Universal 2\" binary `.app` bundle, a folder with a specific
structure which stores the executable, libraries and all the project
files. This bundle can be exported as is, packed in a ZIP archive or DMG
disk image (only supported when exporting from a computer running
macOS). [Universal binaries for macOS support both Intel x86_64 and
ARM64 (Apple Silicon)
architectures](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/building-a-universal-macos-binary).

> [!WARNING]
> Due to file system limitations, raw `.app` bundles exported from
> Windows lack `executable` flag and won\'t run on macOS. To fix it, use
> the `chmod +x {executable_name}` command after transferring the
> exported `.app` to macOS or Linux. Projects exported as `.zip` aren\'t
> affected by this issue. The main executable located in the
> `Contents/MacOS/` subfolder, as well as optional helper executables in
> the `Contents/Helpers/` subfolder, should have `executable` permission
> for the `.app` bundle to be valid.

## Requirements

- Download the Godot export templates. Use the Godot menu:
  `Editor > Manage Export Templates`.
- A valid and unique `Bundle identifier` should be set in the
  `Application` section of the export options.

> [!WARNING]
> Projects exported without code signing and notarization will be
> blocked by Gatekeeper if they are downloaded from unknown sources, see
> the
> `Running Godot apps on macOS <doc_running_on_macos>`{.interpreted-text
> role="ref"} page for more information.

## Code signing and notarization

By default, macOS will run only applications that are signed and
notarized. If you use any other signing configuration, see
`Running Godot apps on macOS <doc_running_on_macos>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for workarounds.

To notarize an app, you **must** have a valid [Apple Developer ID
Certificate](https://developer.apple.com/).

### If you have an Apple Developer ID Certificate and exporting from macOS

Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) command line tools
and open Xcode at least once or run the
`sudo xcodebuild -license accept` command to accept license agreement.

#### To sign exported app

- Select `Xcode codesign` in the `Code Signing > Codesign` option.
- Set valid Apple ID certificate identity (certificate \"Common Name\")
  in the `Code Signing > Identity` section.

#### To notarize exported app

- Select `Xcode altool` in the `Notarization > Notarization` option.
- Disable the `Debugging` entitlement.
- Set valid Apple ID login / app. specific password or [App Store
  Connect](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi)
  API UUID / Key in the `Notarization` section.

You can use the `xcrun notarytool history` command to check notarization
status and use the `xcrun notarytool log {ID}` command to download the
notarization log.

If you encounter notarization issues, see [Resolving common notarization
issues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_macos_software_before_distribution/resolving_common_notarization_issues)
for more info.

After notarization is completed, [staple the
ticket](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_macos_software_before_distribution/customizing_the_notarization_workflow)
to the exported project.

### If you have an Apple Developer ID Certificate and exporting from Linux or Windows

Install [PyOxidizer
rcodesign](https://github.com/indygreg/apple-platform-rs/tree/main/apple-codesign),
and configure the path to `rcodesign` in the
`Editor Settings > Export > macOS > rcodesign`.

#### To sign exported app

- Select `PyOxidizer rcodesign` in the `Code Signing > Codesign` option.
- Set valid Apple ID PKCS \#12 certificate file and password in the
  `Code Signing` section.

#### To notarize exported app

- Select `PyOxidizer rcodesign` in the `Notarization > Notarization`
  option.
- Disable the `Debugging` entitlement.
- Set valid [App Store
  Connect](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi)
  API UUID / Key in the `Notarization` section.

You can use the `rcodesign notary-log` command to check notarization
status.

After notarization is completed, use the `rcodesign staple` command to
staple the ticket to the exported project.

### If you do not have an Apple Developer ID Certificate

- Select `Built-in (ad-hoc only)` in the `Code Signing > Codesign`
  option.
- Select `Disabled` in the `Notarization > Notarization` option.

In this case Godot will use an ad-hoc signature, which will make running
an exported app easier for the end users, see the
`Running Godot apps on macOS <doc_running_on_macos>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} page for more information.

## Entitlements

### Hardened Runtime Entitlements

Hardened Runtime entitlements manage security options and resource
access policy. See [Hardened
Runtime](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/hardened_runtime?language=objc)
for more info.

| Entitlement | Description |
|----|----|
| Allow JIT Code Execution[^7] | Allows creating writable and executable memory for JIT code. If you are using add-ons with dynamic or self-modifying native code, enable them according to the add-on documentation. |
| Allow Unsigned Executable Memory[^8] | Allows creating writable and executable memory without JIT restrictions. If you are using add-ons with dynamic or self-modifying native code, enable them according to the add-on documentation. |
| Allow DYLD Environment Variables[^9] | Allows app to uss dynamic linker environment variables to inject code. If you are using add-ons with dynamic or self-modifying native code, enable them according to the add-on documentation. |
| Disable Library Validation | Allows app to load arbitrary libraries and frameworks. Enable it if you are using GDExtension add-ons or ad-hoc signing, or want to support user-provided external add-ons. |
| Audio Input | Enable if you need to use the microphone or other audio input sources, if it\'s enabled you should also provide usage message in the [privacy/microphone_usage_description]{.title-ref} option. |
| Camera | Enable if you need to use the camera, if it\'s enabled you should also provide usage message in the [privacy/camera_usage_description]{.title-ref} option. |
| Location | Enable if you need to use location information from Location Services, if it\'s enabled you should also provide usage message in the [privacy/location_usage_description]{.title-ref} option. |
| Address Book | [^10] Enable to allow access contacts in the user\'s address book, if it\'s enabled you should also provide usage message in the [privacy/address_book_usage_description]{.title-ref} option. |

### App Sandbox Entitlement

The App Sandbox restricts access to user data, networking and devices.
Sandboxed apps can\'t access most of the file system, can\'t use custom
file dialogs and execute binaries (using `OS.execute` and
`OS.create_process`) outside the `.app` bundle. See [App
Sandbox](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/app_sandbox?language=objc)
for more info.

> [!NOTE]
> To distribute an app through the App Store, you must enable the App
> Sandbox.

| Entitlement | Description |
|----|----|
| Enabled | Enables App Sandbox. |
| Network Server | Enable to allow app to listen for incoming network connections. |
| Network Client | Enable to allow app to establish outgoing network connections. |
| Device USB | Enable to allow app to interact with USB devices. This entitlement is required to use wired controllers. |
| Device Bluetooth | Enable to allow app to interact with Bluetooth devices. This entitlement is required to use wireless controllers. |
| Files Downloads[^15] | Allows read or write access to the user\'s \"Downloads\" folder. |
| Files Pictures[^16] | Allows read or write access to the user\'s \"Pictures\" folder. |

> [!NOTE]
> You can override default entitlements by selecting custom entitlements
> file, in this case all other entitlement are ignored.
