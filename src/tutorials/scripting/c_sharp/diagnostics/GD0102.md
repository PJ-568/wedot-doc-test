## Cause

An unsupported type is specified for a member annotated with the
`[Export]` attribute when a
`Variant-compatible type <c_sharp_variant_compatible_types>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} is expected.

## Rule description

Every exported member must be Variant-compatible so it can be marshalled
by the engine.

``` csharp
class SomeType { }

// SomeType is not a valid member type because it doesn't derive from GodotObject,
// so it's not compatible with Variant.
[Export]
public SomeType InvalidProperty { get; set; }

// System.Int32 is a valid type because it's compatible with Variant.
[Export]
public int ValidProperty { get; set; }
```

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, change the member\'s type to be
Variant-compatible or remove the `[Export]` attribute.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule. Members with types that can\'t
be marshalled will result in runtime errors.
