## Cause

A delegate annotated with the `[Signal]` attribute has a return type
when `void` was expected.

## Rule description

Every signal must return `void`. There can be multiple callbacks
registered for each signal, if signal callbacks could return something
it wouldn\'t be possible to determine which of the returned values to
use.

``` csharp
// This signal delegate is invalid because it doesn't return void.
public int InvalidSignalEventHandler();

// This signal delegate is valid because it returns void.
public void ValidSignalEventHandler();
```

Take a look at the `C# signals <doc_c_sharp_signals>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} documentation for more information about how to declare and
use signals.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, change the delegate to return `void` or
remove the `[Signal]` attribute from the delegate. Note that removing
the attribute will mean the signal is not registered.

> [!TIP]
> If the signal doesn\'t need to interact with Godot, consider using [C#
> events](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/events/)
> directly. Pure C# events allow you to use any C# type for its
> parameters.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule. Signal delegates that return
something will result in unexpected runtime errors.
