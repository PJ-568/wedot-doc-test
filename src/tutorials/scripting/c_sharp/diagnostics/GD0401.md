## Cause

A type annotated with the `[GlobalClass]` attribute does not derive from
`GodotObject`.

## Rule description

The `[GlobalClass]` has no effect for types that don\'t derive from
`GodotObject`. Every
`global class <doc_c_sharp_global_classes>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} must ultimately derive from `GodotObject` so it can be
marshalled.

``` csharp
// This type is not registered as a global class because it doesn't derive from GodotObject.
[GlobalClass]
class SomeType { }

// This type is a global class because it derives from Godot.Node
// which ultimately derives from GodotObject.
[GlobalClass]
class MyNode : Node { }

// This type is a global class because it derives from Godot.Resource
// which ultimately derives from GodotObject.
[GlobalClass]
class MyResource : Resource { }
```

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, change the type to derive from
`GodotObject` or remove the `[GlobalClass]` attribute.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule. Adding the `[GlobalClass]` to
a type that doesn\'t derive from `GodotObject` is an easy mistake to
make and this warning helps users realize that it may result in
unexpected errors.
