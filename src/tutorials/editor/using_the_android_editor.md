# Using the Android editor {#doc_using_the_android_editor}

In 2023, we added an [Android port of the
editor](https://godotengine.org/article/android_godot_editor_play_store_beta_release/)
that can be used to create, develop, and export 2D and 3D projects on
Android devices.

The app can be downloaded from the [Godot download
page](https://godotengine.org/download/android/) or from the [Google
Play
Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.godotengine.editor.v4).

> [!NOTE]
> The Android editor is in early access, while we continue to refine the
> experience. See
> `doc_using_the_android_editor_limitations`{.interpreted-text

## Android devices support

The Android editor requires devices running Android 5 Lollipop or
higher, with at least OpenGL 3 support. This includes (not exhaustive):

- Android tablets, foldables and large phones
- Android-powered netbooks
- Chromebooks supporting Android apps

## Runtime Permissions

- [All files access
  permission](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/manage-all-files#all-files-access):
  Enables the editor to create, import, and read project files from any
  file locations on the device. Without this permission, the editor is
  still functional, but has limited access to the device\'s files and
  directories.
- [REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES):
  Enables the editor to install exported project APKs.
- [RECORD_AUDIO](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#RECORD_AUDIO):
  Requested when the
  [audio/driver/enable_input](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_projectsettings.html#class-projectsettings-property-audio-driver-enable-input)
  project setting is enabled.

## Tips & Tricks {#tips-tricks}

**Input**

- For the best experience and high level of productivity, connecting a
  bluetooth keyboard & mouse is recommended to interact with the Android
  editor. The Android editor supports all of the [usual shortcuts and
  key
  mappings](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/editor/default_key_mapping.html).
- When interacting with keyboard & mouse, you can decrease the size of
  the scrollbar using the
  [interface/touchscreen/increase_scrollbar_touch_area](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_editorsettings.html#class-editorsettings-property-interface-touchscreen-increase-scrollbar-touch-area)
  editor setting.
- For 2D projects, the [block coding
  plugin](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/3095) can provide
  a block-based visual alternative to composing scripts when lacking a
  connected hardware keyboard.

**Multi-tasking**

- On smaller devices, enabling and using picture-in-picture (PiP) mode
  provides the ability to easily transition between the *Editor* and the
  *Play window*.
  - PiP can be enabled via the
    [run/window_placement/play_window_pip_mode](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/classes/class_editorsettings.html#class-editorsettings-property-run-window-placement-play-window-pip-mode)
    editor setting.
  - The
    [run/window_placement/android_window](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/classes/class_editorsettings.html#class-editorsettings-property-run-window-placement-android-window)
    editor setting can be used to specify whether the *Play* window
    should always launch in PiP mode.
  - **Note:** In PiP mode, the *Play* window does not have input access.

**Projects sync**

- Syncing projects via Git can be done by downloading an Android Git
  client. We recommend the [Termux terminal](https://termux.dev/en/), an
  Android terminal emulator which provides access to common terminal
  utilities such Git and SSH.
  - **Note:** To use Git with the Termux terminal, you\'ll need to grant
    *WRITE* permission to the terminal. This can be done by [running the
    following
    command](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Termux-setup-storage) from
    within the terminal: `termux-setup-storage`

**Plugins**

- GDExtension plugins work as expected, but require the plugin developer
  to provide native Android binaries.

## Limitations & known issues {#doc_using_the_android_editor_limitations}

Here are the known limitations and issues of the Android editor:

- No gradle build support.
- No support for Android plugins as they require gradle build support.
  GDExtensions plugins are supported.
- No C#/Mono support.
- No support for external script editors.
- While available, the *Vulkan Forward+* renderer is not recommended due
  to severe performance issues.
- UX not optimized for Android phones form-factor.
- [Android Go
  devices](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/androidgo) lacks
  the *All files access* permission required for device read/write
  access. As a workaround, when using an Android Go device, it\'s
  recommended to create new projects only in the Android *Documents* or
  *Downloads* directories.
- The editor doesn\'t properly resume when *Don\'t keep activities* is
  enabled in the *Developer Options*.
- There is a [bug](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/70751)
  with the Samsung keyboard that causes random input to be inserted when
  writing scripts. It\'s recommended to use the [Google keyboard
  (Gboard)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.inputmethod.latin)
  instead.
