# Editor introduction {#doc_editor_introduction}

In this section, we cover the Godot editor in general, from its
interface to using it with the command line.

## Editor\'s interface

The following pages explain how to use the various windows, workspaces,
and docks that make up the Godot editor. We cover some specific
editors\' interface in other sections where appropriate. For example,
the `animation editor
<doc_introduction_animation>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

## XR editor

Godot offers a port of the editor designed to run natively on Meta Quest
devices. The port can be downloaded from the [Meta Horizon
Store](https://www.meta.com/experiences/godot-game-engine/7713660705416473/),
or from the [Godot download
page](https://godotengine.org/download/preview/).

## Android editor

Godot offers a native port of the editor running entirely on Android
devices. The Android port can be downloaded from the [Android Downloads
page](https://godotengine.org/download/android/). While we strive for
feature parity with the Desktop version of the editor, the Android port
has a certain amount of caveats you should be aware of.

## Web editor

Godot offers an HTML5 version of the editor running entirely in your
browser. No download is required to use it, but it has a certain amount
of caveats you should be aware of.

developers, such as calling Godot from the command line and using an
external text editor like Visual Studio Code or Emacs.

## Managing editor features

Godot allows you to remove features from the editor. This may be useful
if you\'re an educator trying to ease students into the editor slowly,
or if you\'re working on a project that\'s only 2D or only 3D and don\'t
want to see what you don\'t need.
