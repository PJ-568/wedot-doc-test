# Using the XR editor {#doc_using_the_xr_editor}

In 2024, we introduced the [Godot XR
editor](https://godotengine.org/article/godot-editor-horizon-store-early-access-release/),
a version of the Godot editor **designed to run natively on XR
devices**, enabling the creation, development and export of 2D, 3D, and
**XR** apps and games directly on device.

The app can be downloaded from the [Meta Horizon
Store](https://www.meta.com/experiences/godot-game-engine/7713660705416473/),
or from the [Godot download
page](https://godotengine.org/download/preview/).

> [!NOTE]
> The XR editor is in early access, while we continue to refine the
> experience. See

## XR devices support

For now, the Godot XR editor is only available for the following [Meta
Quest](https://www.meta.com/quest/) devices running **Meta Horizon OS
v69 or higher**:

> - Meta Quest 3
> - Meta Quest 3s
> - Meta Quest Pro

> [!NOTE]
> We are working to add support for more XR devices, including PCVR
> devices.

## Runtime Permissions

- [All files access
  permission](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/manage-all-files#all-files-access):
  Enables the editor to create, import, and read project files from any
  file locations on the device. Without this permission, the editor is
  still functional, but has limited access to the device\'s files and
  directories.
- [REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES):
  Enables the editor to install exported project APKs.
- [RECORD_AUDIO](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#RECORD_AUDIO):
  Requested when the
  [audio/driver/enable_input](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_projectsettings.html#class-projectsettings-property-audio-driver-enable-input)
  project setting is enabled.
- [USE_SCENE](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/native/native-spatial-data-perm/):
  Required to enable and access the scene APIs when running an XR
  project.

## Tips & Tricks {#tips-tricks}

**Input**

- For the best experience and high level of productivity, connecting a
  bluetooth keyboard & mouse is recommended to interact with the XR
  editor. The XR editor supports all of the [usual shortcuts and key
  mappings](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/editor/default_key_mapping.html).
- When interacting with tracked controllers or tracked hands, you can
  toggle on the
  [interface/touchscreen/enable_long_press_as_right_click](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_editorsettings.html#class-editorsettings-property-interface-touchscreen-enable-long-press-as-right-click)
  editor setting to enable right-click by long press.
- When interacting with tracked controllers or tracked hands, you can
  increase the size of the scrollbar using the
  [interface/touchscreen/increase_scrollbar_touch_area](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_editorsettings.html#class-editorsettings-property-interface-touchscreen-increase-scrollbar-touch-area)
  editor setting.

**Multi-tasking**

- [Theater
  View](https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/meta-quest-v67-update-new-window-layout-creator-content-horizon-feed/)
  can be used to fullscreen the *Editor window*.
- Enable [Seamless
  Multitasking](https://www.uploadvr.com/seamless-multitasking-experimental-quest/),
  available in the Quest *Experimental Settings*, to enable the ability
  to quickly transition between a running XR project and the *Editor
  window*.
- When developing a non-XR project, the Godot editor app icon will
  provide the ability to switch between the *Editor window* and the
  *Play window* when the latter is active, using Quest\'s *App menu*
  feature.
- When developing and running an XR project, you can bring back the
  *Editor window* by:
  - Pressing on the *Meta* button to invoke the menu bar
  - Clicking on the Godot editor app icon to summon the *App menu*, and
    select the *Editor window* tile.

**Projects sync**

- Syncing projects via Git can be done by downloading an Android Git
  client. We recommend the [Termux terminal](https://termux.dev/en/), an
  Android terminal emulator which provides access to common terminal
  utilities such Git and SSH.
  - **Note:** To use Git with the Termux terminal, you\'ll need to grant
    *WRITE* permission to the terminal. This can be done by [running the
    following
    command](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Termux-setup-storage) from
    within the terminal: `termux-setup-storage`

**Plugins**

- GDExtension plugins work as expected, but require the plugin developer
  to provide native Android binaries.

## Limitations & known issues {#doc_using_the_xr_editor_limitations}

Here are the known limitations and issues of the XR editor:

- No Meta Quest 2 support due to the limited amount of memory on the
  device. However advanced users can grab the XR editor APK from the
  [download page](https://godotengine.org/download/preview/) and
  sideload it onto their device if they desire to do so.
- No gradle build support.
- No support for Android plugins as they require gradle build support.
  GDExtension plugins are supported.
- No C#/Mono support.
- No support for external script editors.
- While available, the *Vulkan Forward+* renderer is not recommended due
  to severe performance issues.
