# Fog shaders {#doc_fog_shader}

Fog shaders are used to define how fog is added (or subtracted) from a
scene in a given area. Fog shaders are always used together with
`FogVolumes <class_FogVolume>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
volumetric fog. Fog shaders only have one processing function, the
`fog()` function.

The resolution of the fog shaders depends on the resolution of the
volumetric fog froxel grid. Accordingly, the level of detail that a fog
shader can add depends on how close the
`FogVolume <class_FogVolume>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} is to the
camera.

Fog shaders are a special form of compute shader that is called once for
every froxel that is touched by an axis aligned bounding box of the
associated `FogVolume <class_FogVolume>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
This means that froxels that just barely touch a given
`FogVolume <class_FogVolume>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} will still
be used.

## Built-ins

Values marked as `in` are read-only. Values marked as `out` can
optionally be written to and will not necessarily contain sensible
values. Samplers cannot be written to so they are not marked.

## Global built-ins

Global built-ins are available everywhere, including in custom
functions.

| Built-in | Description |
|----|----|
| in float **TIME** | Global time since the engine has started, in seconds. It repeats after every `3,600` seconds (which can be changed with the `rollover<class_ProjectSettings_property_rendering/limits/time/time_rollover_secs>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} setting). It\'s not affected by `time_scale<class_Engine_property_time_scale>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} or pausing. If you need a `TIME` variable that can be scaled or paused, add your own `global shader uniform<doc_shading_language_global_uniforms>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and update it each frame. |
| in float **PI** | A `PI` constant (`3.141592`). A ratio of a circle\'s circumference to its diameter and amount of radians in half turn. |
| in float **TAU** | A `TAU` constant (`6.283185`). An equivalent of `PI * 2` and amount of radians in full turn. |
| in float **E** | An `E` constant (`2.718281`). Euler\'s number and a base of the natural logarithm. |

## Fog built-ins

All of the output values of fog volumes overlap one another. This allows
`FogVolumes <class_FogVolume>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to be
rendered efficiently as they can all be drawn at once.

| Built-in | Description |
|----|----|
| in vec3 **WORLD_POSITION** | Position of current froxel cell in world space. |
| in vec3 **OBJECT_POSITION** | Position of the center of the current `FogVolume <class_FogVolume>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} in world space. |
| in vec3 **UVW** | 3-dimensional UV, used to map a 3D texture to the current `FogVolume <class_FogVolume>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. |
| in vec3 **SIZE** | Size of the current `FogVolume <class_FogVolume>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} when its `shape<class_FogVolume_property_shape>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} has a size. |
| in vec3 **SDF** | Signed distance field to the surface of the `FogVolume <class_FogVolume>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. Negative if inside volume, positive otherwise. |
| out vec3 **ALBEDO** | Output base color value, interacts with light to produce final color. Only written to fog volume if used. |
| out float **DENSITY** | Output density value. Can be negative to allow subtracting one volume from another. Density must be used for fog shader to write anything at all. |
| out vec3 **EMISSION** | Output emission color value, added to color during light pass to produce final color. Only written to fog volume if used. |
